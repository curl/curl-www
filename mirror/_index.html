TITLE(How To Mirror)
<p>
 We provide the download packages for easy mirroring using rsync. You can
 mirror the contents at any time, using these command lines:
<pre>
  rsync -t --delete rsync://cool.haxx.se/curldownload
</pre>
<p>
 We recommend syncing at least daily so that updates take effect swiftly
 enough.

<p>
 If you decide to run a download mirror for us (or if you decide to no longer
 run one), please tell us at curl-web at haxx.se so that we can add it to or
 remove it from the
 <a href="https://github.com/bagder/curl-www/blob/master/latest.pl">latest.pl</a>
 script on the web site.
