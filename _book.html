TITLE(Everything curl - the book)
<p>
  <i>Everything curl</i> is an extensive, detailed and totally free book,
  available in multiple formats.

<p>
  Learn how to use curl. How to use libcurl. How to build them from source or
  perhaps how the curl project accepts contributions. There is something for
  everyone in this, from the casual first-time users to the experienced
  libcurl hackers.
<p>
  Everything curl is written by Daniel Stenberg but is an open project that
  accepts your contributions and help. The book is constantly updated.

  paperback version of the book (ISBN 978-91-639-6501-2). The printed version
  is sold out since a long time back and there has been no further efforts to
  make additional editions available.
