 Please consider sponsoring the project. Maintaining, bug tracking, hosting
 and supporting this project requires resources. You can help!

<p>
 We do not consider single-shot donations as "sponsorships". Those are
 donations and while welcome, they will not be honored by a mention
 here. Sponsors mentioned here keep supporting the project long-term by
 covering some sort of notable cost to the benefit of the project and its
 users.

<p>
 The <b>best way to sponsor</b> this project is to allow a paid engineer or
 two to spend work hours on curl. Responding to email and writing curl
 improvements. Alternatively, donate to curl on
 the <a href="https://opencollective.com/curl/">opencollective</a> page.
