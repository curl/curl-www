 A few things to keep in mind to improve your searches on how you read the
 results from your searches:
<ul>

<li> The contents of this site is frequently indexed by Google, but you should
 still not assume that you will be able to search on very recent additions to
 the site.

<li> There are more than 16,000 HTML pages at this site. Specify your search
 with several keywords for better results.

<li> The search results may include mailing list postings that may contain
 details and inaccurate facts. We keep all mailing list postings ever posted
 and some may be a bit out-of-date or possibly at times they were already
 incorrect when they were posted the first time!

<li> The search results might offer links to source code, which could be
 a bit confusing to users not used to such reading.

</ul>
