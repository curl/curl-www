# curl-www

This is (most of) the curl.se website contents. It mostly builds static
HTML files that are preprocessed.

## Prerequisites

The website is a on old custom made setup that mostly builds static HTML
files from a set of source files using (GNU) `make`. The sources files are
preprocessed with what is basically a souped-up C preprocessor called `fcpp`
and a set of `perl` scripts. The manpages get converted to HTML with
`roffit`.

Markdown is converted to HTML with `pandoc`.

Make sure the following tools are in your $PATH.

 - curl
 - GNU date
 - GNU enscript
 - [fcpp](https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/fcpp/)
 - GNU make
 - pandoc
 - perl (with CPAN packages: CGI, HTML::Entities)
 - roffit
 - zip

## Build

Once you have cloned the Git repo the first time, invoke `sh bootstrap.sh` once
to get a symlink and some some initial local files setup, and then you can
build the website locally by invoking make in the source root tree.

Note that this does not make you a complete website mirror, as some scripts
and files are only available on the real actual site, but should give you
enough to let you load most HTML pages locally.

## Edit the web

[Web editing guidelines](https://curl.se/web-editing.html)

# curl.local

To run a local copy of the curl website, have a local Apache or python
to serve `curl.local` on `127.0.0.1`. Add this line to `/etc/hosts`:

    127.0.0.1 curl.local

## Apache httpd config

A config file for apache2 to run a virtual server for `curl.local` on your
local machine might look like this:

~~~
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName curl.local
    ServerAdmin [my email address]
    DocumentRoot [full path to the curl-www build]

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/curllocal-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/curllocal-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

<Directory [full path to the curl-www build]>
   Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
   AllowOverride All
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
   Require all granted
</Directory>
~~~

## Python3

From the directory containing the website, run:

    python3 -m http.server --cgi -b curl.local 8000
