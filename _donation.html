SUBTITLE(How)
<p>
 <big><a href="https://opencollective.com/curl/donate">Donate!</a></big>
<p>
  (Donations are done to Open Source Collective 501c6, a US non-profit that
  collects and holds funds on the behalf of the curl project.)
<p>
SUBTITLE(Why)
<p>
  To ensure that the curl project continues to thrive. Even open source
  projects has expenses! You can use curl forever without paying anything, but
  maybe you think you have got quite a lot and feel you could contribute a
  little back?
<p>
  See also Mary Gardiner's excellent
  guide <a href="https://puzzling.org/pub/HOWTO/Free/">How To Pay for Free
  Software</a>.

SUBTITLE(What to donate)
<p>
  Donate your time. Answer questions, contribute code, review patches and help
  out. Or let one of your employees do this for the benefit of the project!
<p>
  If you cannot donate time or skill, consider donating a small amount of
  money. Maybe even do it in a recurring manner?
<p>
  Anyone donating 100USD per month, or more, is considered
  a <a href="/sponsors.html">sponsor</a> and could get listed on that page -
  assuming the team agrees.

SUBTITLE(What are the donated funds used for?)
<p>
  Donated money is strictly and only used for project expenses, in particular
  the <a href="/docs/bugbounty.html">bug bounty</a> and the curl annual
  conference series <b>curl up</b>.
<p>
  Please note that sponsorships and donations are exactly that: donations to
  the curl project. They are used to help and further the project as the
  project leadership deems best. No goods or services are expected or promised
  in return. Requests for refunds for such purposes are rejected.
