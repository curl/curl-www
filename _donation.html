 DONATE
<p>
 If you use curl a lot and like it, or perhaps your company makes money from
 curl or curl-related activities, why not support the project with a donation?

<p>
 Donations made to this paypal account go to Daniel Stenberg, head of the curl
 project and main author. Daniel will keep track of the money and spend them
 on suitable curl-related activities.
