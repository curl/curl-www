SUBTITLE(How)
<p>
 <big><a href="https://opencollective.com/curl/donate">Donate!</a></big>
<p>
  (Donations are done to Open Source Collective 501c6, a US non-profit that
  collects and holds funds on the behalf of the curl project.)
<p>
SUBTITLE(Why)
<p>
  To ensure that the curl project continues to strive. Even open source
  projects has expenses! You can use curl forever without paying anything, but
  maybe you think you've got quite a lot and feel you could contribute a
  little back?
<p>
  See also Mary Gardiner's excellent
  guide <a href="https://puzzling.org/pub/HOWTO/Free/">How To Pay for Free
  Software</a>.
  
SUBTITLE(What to donate)
<p>
  Donate your time. Answer questions, contribute code, review patches and help out.
  Or let one of your employees do this for the benefit of the project!
<p>
  If you cannot donate time or skill, consider donating a small amount of
  money. Maybe even do it in a recurring manner?
<p>
  Anyone donating 100USD per month, or more, is considered
  a <a href="/sponsors.html">sponsor</a> and is entitled to request to get
  listed on that page.
  
SUBTITLE(What are the donated funds used for?)
<p>
  Donated money is strictly and only used for project expenses, in particular
  the <a href="/docs/bugbounty.html">bug bounty</a> and the curl annual
  conference series <b>curl up</b>.
