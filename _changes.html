<li> Now features an 'auto referer' so that curl can set the "correct" referer
     when following location:
<li> removed CURLOPT_PROGRESSMODE from the lib
<li> win32 now sends data binary to stdout unless -B / --use-ascii is specified
<li> added a README.win32 file
<li> libcurl offers a progress meter callback
<li> Custom headers when doing location: works again
<li> libcurl is much more threadsafe
<li> Many portability issues have been smoothened out
<li> Lots of symbol renamings in the libcurl public stuff.
<li> The FTP range support were buggy and is now corrected
<li> <b>Major</b> re-organisation of all library internals to allow for a new
     library interface.
<li> A buffer overflow (with URLs larger than 4096 characters) was fixed
<li> The FTP sessions are slightly modified and now they're using CWD to
     change to the directory where the operation is requested.
<li> FTP URLs are now treated more like the RFC specifies (minor change)
<li> now sends user agent string when talking ftp through a http proxy
<li> made the progress meter nicer for sizes between 10 and 100 megabytes
<li> no longer checks for install twice in the configure script
<li> improved win32 headers for VC++ compiling
<li> minor fix when using libcurl in a multi-threaded program
<li> the OS/2 port was slightly adjusted
<li> location following through a http proxy on a specified non-default port didn't work
<li> location following to an absolute URL on a different port didn't work
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.5.2
<ul>
<li> corrected the -D mockup that caused 6.5.1 to crash
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.5.1
<ul>
 <li> curl_unescape() buffer overrun removed
 <li> -w 'http_code' works!
 <li> OS/2 port
 <li> adjusted to compile smoothly with MS VC++ 
 <li> -D/--dump-header now only writes the file when needed, and not before
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.5
<ul>
 <li> now sends cookies space separated
 <li> Corrected OpenSSL 0.9.5 compliance problems
 <li> the perl scripts are moved out from the distribution
 <li> Ultrix port
 <li> -N now disables output buffering
 <li> the new -w/--write-out allows for script writers to specify what curl should output after a successful request
 <li> -K config files no longer have a max line length
 <li> new progress meter to better show both upload and download
 <li> MacOS X port
 <li> upload and download now performs simultaneously in case of need. This will make posting of big forms that are "echoed back" to finally work.
 <li> the cookie parser shouldn't crash on empty cookie names, nor should it send empty cookies to the server anymore.
 <li> -b now supports both @[filename] and @- for stdin
 <li> unlimited line lengths in the config file
 <li> Compiles on sunos4 again
 <li> Corrected the removed possibility to chose the progress bar
 <li> Made the max display width with progress bar 79 when the COLUMNS variable
      isn't set.
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.4
<ul>
 <li> Improved progress meter
 <li> Ability to run --quote commands <i>after</i> ftp transfers now, as well as before
 <li> Getting files with URL syntax codes (%-stuff) from a ftp server was not dealt with nicely
 <li> -b corrupted the cookie header lines when they were read off a server
 <li> Cleaned up the interface between the lib and the curl tool.
 <li> Made the -X's long option change name to --request and now you can specify full request command for ftp listings (like "LIST -l").
 <li> Improved the --stderr workings for win32.
 <li> BeOS port by Lars J. Aas!
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.3.1
<ul>
 <li> posting an empty variable with -F, like "name=" did cause curl to hang
 <li> when the download from a http server gets cut off curl now warns about it
 <li> better error checks when fwrite()ing the output
 <li> minor fix that may correct the amiga-port problem
 <li> A <b>lethal</b> cookie bug was fixed.

</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.3
<ul>
 <li> -z (date-dependent HTTP fetches) now works better since we're doing a
   date comparison in the client as well.
 <li> -b/--cookie is now capable of parsing and understanding the cookies saved
   in a netscape cookie file. This is useful when you want your script to
   better inherit the properties of your previous browser session.
 <li>
   -H/--header now is capable of replacing internal headers. If you add
   a header that would've been used internally, the added will be used instead.
 <li> Corrected several mistakes in the man page.
 <li> -I now works for ftp-files too. It merely shows the file size now.
 <li> Simple range support added for ftp downloads.
 <li>
  Following location: in a https:// header could lead to a crash. Jongki
  Suwandi found this for us!
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.2
<ul>
 <li> another bug in loction: following with proxies when the protocol part
  isn't specified was fixed

 <li> removed double text output when ftp-downloading
 <li> config.guess recognizes Mac OS X
 <li> HTTP headers are now parsed case insensitive!
 <li> --stderr now supports redirecting the stderr stream to stdout or a file
   now. This is mainly for victims of Windows.
 <li> the configure script understands --without-ssl now!
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.1
<ul>
 <li> zlib proved not to be as easy to add as I had anticipated. I'll keep
      it on hold for now.
 <li> moved the libcurl include files into a subdir named curl
 <li> #include zlib.h fixes 
 <li> adjusted the maketgz script to reduce reruns of the configure when
      building
</ul>

<p> Fixed in 6.1 beta
<ul>
 <li> -d now can get data from a file or stdin
 <li> HTTP: "Accept-Encoding: gzip,compress,deflate" - experiments
 <li> Misc: Multiple URL download capacity
 <li> HTTP: Made the -F form posting accept files from stdin as well.
</ul>
