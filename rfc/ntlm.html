<h1>The NTLM Authentication Protocol and Security Support Provider</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article seeks to describe the NTLM authentication protocol and related
security support provider functionality at an intermediate to advanced level of
detail, suitable as a reference for implementors.  It is hoped that this
document will evolve into a comprehensive description of NTLM; at this
time there are omissions, both in the author's knowledge and in his
documentation, and almost certainly inaccuracies.  However, this document
should at least be able to provide a solid foundation for further research.  The
information presented herein was used as the basis for the implementation of
NTLM authentication in the open-source jCIFS library, available at
<a href="http://jcifs.samba.org">http://jcifs.samba.org</a>.  This
documentation is based on independent research by the author and analysis of
functionality implemented in the <a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a>
software suite.

<h2>What is NTLM?</h2>
<p>
NTLM is a suite of authentication and session security protocols used in various
Microsoft network protocol implementations and supported by the NTLM Security
Support Provider ("NTLMSSP").  Originally used for authentication and
negotiation of secure DCE/RPC, NTLM is also used throughout Microsoft's
systems as an integrated single sign-on mechanism.  It is probably best
recognized as part of the "Integrated Windows Authentication" stack for
HTTP authentication; however, it is also used in Microsoft implementations of
SMTP, POP3, IMAP (all part of Exchange), CIFS/SMB, Telnet, SIP, and possibly
others.
<p>
The NTLM Security Support Provider provides authentication, integrity, and
confidentiality services within the Window Security Support Provider Interface
(SSPI) framework.  SSPI specifies a core set of security functionality that is
implemented by supporting providers; the NTLMSSP is such a provider.  The
SSPI specifies, and the NTLMSSP implements, the following core operations:
<p>
<ol>
    <li><p>Authentication -- NTLM provides a challenge-response authentication mechanism, in which clients are able to prove their identities without sending a password to the server.</p></li>
    <li><p>Signing -- The NTLMSSP provides a means of applying a digital "signature" to a message.  This ensures that the signed message has not been modified (either accidentally or intentionally) and that that signing party has knowledge of a shared secret.  NTLM implements a symmetric signature scheme (Message Authentication Code, or MAC); that is, a valid signature can only be generated and verified by parties that possess the common shared key.</p></li>
    <li><p>Sealing -- The NTLMSSP implements a symmetric-key encryption mechanism, which provides message confidentiality.  In the case of NTLM, sealing also implies signing (a signed message is not necessarily sealed, but all sealed messages are signed).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
NTLM has been largely supplanted by Kerberos as the authentication protocol of
choice for domain-based scenarios.  However, Kerberos is a trusted-third-party
scheme, and cannot be used in situations where no trusted third party exists;
for example, member servers (servers that are not part of a domain), local
 accounts, and authentication to resources in an untrusted domain.  In such
scenarios, NTLM continues to be the primary authentication mechanism (and
likely will be for a long time).

<a name="ntlmTerminology">
<h2>NTLM Terminology</h2>
<p>
Before we start digging in any further, we will need to define a few terms
used in the various protocols.
<p>
NTLM authentication is a challenge-response scheme, consisting of three
messages, commonly referred to as Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and
Type 3 (authentication).  It basically works like this:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The client sends a Type 1 message to the server.  This primarily contains a
list of features supported by the client and requested of the server.
</li>
<li>
The server responds with a Type 2 message.  This contains a list of features
supported and agreed upon by the server.  Most importantly, however, it
contains a challenge generated by the server.
</li>
<li>
The client replies to the challenge with a Type 3 message.  This contains
several pieces of information about the client, including the domain and
username of the client user.  It also contains one or more responses to the
Type 2 challenge.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The responses in the Type 3 message are the most critical piece, as they prove
to the server that the client user has knowledge of the account password.
<p>
The process of authentication establishes a shared context between the two
involved parties; this includes a shared session key, used for subsequent
signing and sealing operations.
<p>
In this document, to avoid confusion (as much as possible, anyway) the
following convention will be observed:
<ul>
<li>When discussing authentication, the protocol version will use "v-numbering";
for example, "NTLM<b><i>v1</i></b> Authentication".</li>
<li>When discussing session security (signing &amp; sealing), the "v" will be
omitted; for example, "NTLM<b><i>1</i></b> Session Security".
</ul>
<p>
This should keep things fairly clear, except for the possibly awkward case of
"NTLM2 Session Response" authentication (a variant of NTLMv1 authentication
that is used in conjunction with NTLM2 session security).  Hopefully by the
time we get there this will all make much more sense.
<p>
For our purposes, a "<tt>short</tt>" is a little-endian, 16-bit unsigned value.
For example, the decimal value "<tt>1234</tt>" represented as a <tt>short</tt>
would be physically laid out as "<tt>0xd204</tt>" in hexadecimal.
<p>
A "<tt>long</tt>" is a little-endian, 32-bit unsigned value.  The decimal value
"<tt>1234</tt>" represented as a <tt>long</tt> in hexidecimal would be
"<tt>0xd2040000</tt>".
<p>
A Unicode string is a string in which each character is represented as a
16-bit little-endian value (16-bit UCS-2 Transformation Format,
little-endian byte order, with no Byte Order Mark and no null-terminator).
The string "hello" in Unicode would be represented hexidecimally as
"<tt>0x680065006c006c006f00</tt>".
<p>
An OEM string is a string in which each character is represented as an
8-bit value from the local machine's native character set (DOS codepage).
There is no null-terminator.  In NTLM messages, OEM strings are typically
presented in uppercase.  The string "HELLO" in OEM would be represented
hexidecimally as "<tt>0x48454c4c4f</tt>".
<p>
A "security buffer" is a structure used to point to a buffer of binary data.
It consists of:
<ol>
<li>
A <tt>short</tt> containing the length of the buffer content in bytes (may be zero).
</li>
<li>
A <tt>short</tt> containing the allocated space for the buffer in bytes
(greater than or equal to the length; typically the same as the length).
</li>
<li>
A <tt>long</tt> containing the offset to the start of the buffer in bytes
(from the beginning of the NTLM message).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So the security buffer "<tt>0xd204d204e1100000</tt>" would be read as:
<p>
Length: <tt>0xd204</tt> (1234 bytes)
<br>
Allocated Space: <tt>0xd204</tt> (1234 bytes)
<br>
Offset: <tt>0xe1100000</tt> (4321 bytes)
<p>
If you started at the first byte in the message, and skipped ahead 4321 bytes,
you would be at the start of the data buffer.  You would read 1234 bytes
(which is the length of the buffer).  Since the allocated space for the buffer
is also 1234 bytes, you would then be at the end of the buffer.

<a name="theNtlmMessageHeaderLayout">
<h2>The NTLM Message Header Layout</h2>
<p>
Now we're ready to look at the physical layout of NTLM authentication message
headers.
<p>
All messages start with the NTLMSSP signature, which is (aptly enough) the
null-terminated ASCII string "NTLMSSP" (hexadecimal
"<tt>0x4e544c4d53535000</tt>").
<p>
Next is a <tt>long</tt> containing the message type (1, 2, or 3).  A Type 1
message, for example, has type "<tt>0x01000000</tt>" in hex.
<p>
This is followed by message-specific information, typically consisting of
security buffers and the message flags.

<a name="theNtlmFlags">
<h3>The NTLM Flags</h3>
<p>
The message flags are contained in a bitfield within the header.  This is a
<tt>long</tt>, in which each bit represents a specific flag.  Most of these
will make more sense later, but we'll go ahead and present them here to
establish a frame of reference for the rest of the discussion.
Flags marked as "unidentified" or "unknown" in the table below are outside the
realm of the author's knowledge (which is not by any means absolute).

As an example, consider a message specifying:

Negotiate Unicode (<tt>0x00000001</tt>)
<br>
Request Target (<tt>0x00000004</tt>)
<br>
Negotiate NTLM (<tt>0x00000200</tt>)
<br>
Negotiate Always Sign (<tt>0x00008000</tt>)

Combining the above gives "<tt>0x00008205</tt>".  This would be physically laid
out as "<tt>0x05820000</tt>" (since it is represented in little-endian byte
order).

The Type 1 message is sent from the client to the server to initiate NTLM
authentication.  Its primary purpose is to establish the "ground rules" for
authentication by indicating supported options via the flags.  Optionally,
it can also provide the server with the client's workstation name and 
the domain in which the client workstation has membership; this information
is used by the server to determine whether the client is eligible for
local authentication.
<p>
Typically, the Type 1 message contains flags from the following set:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <td>Negotiate Unicode (<tt>0x00000001</tt>)</td>

The supplied domain is a security buffer containing the domain in which the
client workstation has membership.  This is always in OEM format, even if
Unicode is supported by the client.
<p>
The supplied workstation is a security buffer containing the client
workstation's name.  This, too, is in OEM rather than Unicode.
<p>
<a name="osVersionStructure">
The OS Version structure was introduced in recent Windows updates; it identifies
the host's operating system build level, and is formatted as follows:
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <th align="right"></th><th align="left">Description</th>

<p>
The operating system build can be found by running "winver.exe"; it should give a string similar to:
<p>
<pre>
    Version 5.1 (Build 2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519 : Service Pack 2)
</pre>
<p>
This yields an OS Version structure of "<tt>0x0501280a0000000f</tt>":
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <td><tt>0x05</tt></td><td>(major version 5)</td>

<p>
Note that the OS Version structure and the supplied domain/workstation are
optional fields.  There are three versions of the Type 1 message that have been
observed in the wild:
<ol>
    <li><p>Version 1 -- The Supplied Domain and Workstation security buffers and OS Version structure are omitted completely.  In this case the message ends after the flags field, and is a fixed-length 16-byte structure.  This form is typically seen in older Win9x-based systems, and is roughly documented in the Open Group's ActiveX reference documentation (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/comsource/techref2/NCH1222X.HTM#ntlm.2.2">Section 11.2.2</a>).</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 2 -- The Supplied Domain and Workstation buffers are present, but the OS Version structure is not.  The data block begins immediately after the security buffer headers, at offset 32.  This form is seen in most out-of-box shipping versions of Windows.</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 3 -- Both the Supplied Domain/Workstation buffers are present, as well as the OS Version structure.  The data block begins after the OS Version structure, at offset 40.  This form was introduced in a relatively recent Service Pack, and is seen on currently-patched versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The "most-minimal" well-formed Type 1 message, therefore, would be:
<p>
<pre>
    4e544c4d535350000100000002020000
</pre>
<p>
This is a "Version 1" Type 1 message containing only the NTLMSSP signature,
the NTLM message type, and the minimal set of flags (Negotiate NTLM and
Negotiate OEM).

Analyzing this information, we can see:
<ul>
<li>
This is an NTLM Type 1 message (from the NTLMSSP Signature and Type 1
Indicator).
</li>
<li>
This client can support either Unicode or OEM strings (the Negotiate Unicode and
Negotiate OEM flags are both set).
</li>
<li>
This client supports NTLM authentication (Negotiate NTLM).
</li>
<li>
The client is requesting that the server send information regarding the
authentication target (Request Target is set).
</li>
<li>
The client is running Windows 2000 (5.0), build 2195 (the production build
number for Windows 2000 systems).
</li>
<li>
This client is sending its domain, which is "<tt>DOMAIN</tt>"
(the Negotiate Domain Supplied flag is set, and the domain name is present in
the Supplied Domain Security Buffer).
</li>
<li>
The client is sending its workstation name, which is "<tt>WORKSTATION</tt>"
(the Negotiate Workstation Supplied flag is set, and the workstation name is
present in the Supplied Workstation Security Buffer).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the supplied workstation and domain are in OEM format.  Additionally,
the order in which the security buffer data blocks are laid out is unimportant;
in the example, the workstation data is placed before the domain data.
<p>
After creating the Type 1 message, the client sends it to the server.  The
server analyzes the message, much as we have just done, and creates a reply.
This brings us to our next topic, the Type 2 message.

The Type 2 message is sent by the server to the client in response to the
client's Type 1 message.  It serves to complete the negotiation of options
with the client, and also provides a challenge to the client.  It may
optionally contain information about the authentication target.

The target name is a security buffer containing the name of the authentication
target.  This is typically sent in response to a client requesting the
target (via the Request Target flag in the Type 1 message).  This can contain
a domain, server, or (apparently) a network share.  The target type is
indicated via the Target Type Domain, Target Type Server, and Target Type
Share flags.  The target name can be either Unicode or OEM, as indicated
by the presence of the appropriate flag in the Type 2 message.
<p>
The challenge is an 8-byte block of random data.  The client will use this
to formulate a response.
<p>
The context field is typically populated when Negotiate Local Call is set.
It contains an SSPI context handle, which allows the client to
"short-circuit" authentication and effectively circumvent responding to the
challenge.  Physically, the context is two <tt>long</tt> values.  This is
covered in greater detail later, in the
"<a href='#localAuthentication'>Local Authentication</a>" section.
<p>
The target information is a security buffer containing a Target Information
block, which is used in calculating
<a href="#theNtlmv2Response">the NTLMv2 response</a> (discussed later).  This

The sequence is terminated by a terminator subblock; this is a subblock
of type "0", of zero length.  Subblocks of type "5" have also been encountered, apparently containing the "parent" DNS domain for servers in subdomains; it
may be that there are other as-yet-unidentified subblock types as well.
<p>
The OS Version structure was <a href="#osVersionStructure">described previously</a>.
<p>
As with the Type 1 message, there are a few versions of the Type 2 that have
been observed:
<ol>
    <li><p>Version 1 -- The Context, Target Information, and OS Version structure are all omitted.  The data block (containing only the contents of the Target Name security buffer) begins at offset 32.  This form is seen in older Win9x-based systems, and is roughly documented in the Open Group's ActiveX reference documentation (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/comsource/techref2/NCH1222X.HTM#ntlm.2.3">Section 11.2.3</a>).</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 2 -- The Context and Target Information fields are present, but the OS Version structure is not.  The data block begins after the Target Information header, at offset 48.  This form is seen in most out-of-box shipping versions of Windows.</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 3 -- The Context, Target Information, and OS Version structure are all present.  The data block begins after the OS Version structure, at offset 56.  Again, the buffers may be empty (yielding a zero-length data block).  This form was introduced in a relatively recent Service Pack, and is seen on currently-patched versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003.</p></li>

An analysis of this message shows:
<ul>
<li>
This is an NTLM Type 2 message (from the NTLMSSP Signature and Type 2
Indicator).
</li>
<li>
The server has indicated that strings will be encoded using Unicode
(the Negotiate Unicode flag is set).
</li>
<li>
The server supports NTLM authentication (Negotiate NTLM).
</li>
<li>
The Target Name provided by the server is populated and represents a domain
(the Target Type Domain flag is set and the domain name is present in the
Target Name Security Buffer).
</li>
<li>
The server is providing a Target Information structure
(Negotiate Target Info is set).  This structure is present in the Target
Information Security Buffer (domain name "<tt>DOMAIN</tt>",
server name "<tt>SERVER</tt>", DNS domain name "<tt>domain.com</tt>",
and DNS server name "<tt>server.domain.com</tt>").

<p>
The Type 3 message is the final step in authentication.  This message contains
the client's responses to the Type 2 challenge, which demonstrate
that the client has knowledge of the account password without sending the
password directly.  The Type 3 message also indicates the authentication target
(domain or server name) and username of the authenticating account, as well as
the client workstation name.
<p>
Note that the flags in the Type 3 message are optional; older clients include
neither the session key nor the flags in the message.  It has been determined
experimentally that the Type 3 flags (when included) do not carry any
additional semantics in connection-oriented authentication; they do not appear
to have any discernable effect on either authentication or the establishment
of session security.  Clients sending flags typically mirror the established
Type 2 settings fairly closely.  It is possible that the flags are sent as a
"reminder" of established options, to allow the server to avoid caching the
negotiated settings.  The Type 3 flags are relevant during
<a href="#datagramAuthentication">datagram-style authentication</a>, however.
<p>
The LM/LMv2 and NTLM/NTLMv2 responses are security buffers containing replies
created from the user's password in response to the Type 2 challenge; the
process for generating these responses is outlined in the next section.
<p>
The target name is a security buffer containing the authentication realm in
which the authenticating account has membership (a domain name for domain
accounts, or server name for local machine accounts).  This is either Unicode
or OEM, depending on the negotiated encoding.
<p>
The user name is a security buffer containing the authenticating account name.
This is either Unicode or OEM, depending on the negotiated encoding.
<p>
The workstation name is a security buffer containing the client workstation's
name.  This is either Unicode or OEM, depending on the negotiated encoding.
<p>
The session key value is used by the session security mechanism during key
exchange; this is discussed in more detail in
<a href="#keyExchange">the Session Security section</a>.
<p>
When "Negotiate Local Call" has been established in the Type 2 message, the
security buffers in the Type 3 message are typically all empty (zero length).
The client "adopts" the SSPI context sent in the Type 2 message,
effectively circumventing the need to calculate an appropriate response.
<p>
The OS Version structure is the same format <a href="#osVersionStructure">described previously</a>.
<p>
Again, there are a few variations of the Type 3 message:
<ol>
    <li><p>Version 1 -- The Session Key, flags, and OS Version structure are omitted.  The data block in this case starts after the Workstation Name security buffer header, at offset 52.  This form is seen in older Win9x-based systems.</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 2 -- The Session Key and flags are included, but the OS Version structure is not.  In this case, the data block begins after the flags field, at offset 64.  This form is seen in most out-of-box shipping versions of Windows, and is roughly documented in the Open Group's ActiveX reference documentation (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/comsource/techref2/NCH1222X.HTM#ntlm.2.4">Section 11.2.4</a>).</p></li>
    <li><p>Version 3 -- The Session Key, flags, and OS Version structure are all present.  The data block begins after the OS Version structure, at offset 72.  This form was introduced in a relatively recent Service Pack, and is seen on currently-patched versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 2003.</p></li>
</ol>

<a name="nameVariations">
<h3>Name Variations</h3>
<p>
In addition to the variations in message layout, user and target names can be
presented in a few different formats within the Type 3 message.  In the typical
scenario, the User Name field is populated with the Windows account name, and
the Target Name is populated with the NT domain name.  However, the username
and/or domain can also be presented in the Kerberos-style "user@domain.com"
format in various combinations.  It has been observed that several variations
are supported, with some possible implications/caveats:
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <th>Format</th>

<tr valign="top">

        Target Name = "<tt>DOMAIN</tt>"
    </td>
    <td>
        This is the "normal" format; the User Name field contains the Windows
        user name, and the Target Name contains the NT-style NetBIOS domain
        or server name.
    </td>

    </td>
    <td>
        Here, the Target Name field in the Type 3 message is populated with the
        DNS domain/realm name (or fully-qualified DNS host name in the case of
        local machine accounts).

    </td>
    <td>
        In this case, the Target Name field is empty (zero-length), and the
        User Name field uses the Kerberos-style "user@realm" format; however,
        the NetBIOS domain name is used instead of the DNS domain.
        It has been observed that this format is not supported for local
        machine accounts; additionally, this form does not appear to be
        supported under NTLMv2/LMv2 authentication.

<h3>Responding to the Challenge</h3>
<p>
The client creates one or more responses to the Type 2 challenge, and sends
these to the server in the Type 3 message.  There are six types of responses:
<ul>
<li>
LM (LAN Manager) Response - Sent by most older clients, this is the "original"
response type.
</li>
<li>
NTLM Response - This is sent by NT-based clients, including Windows
2000 and XP.
</li>
<li>
NTLMv2 Response - A newer response type, introduced in Windows NT Service
Pack 4.  This replaces the NTLM response on systems that have NTLM version 2
enabled.
</li>
<li>
LMv2 Response - The replacement for the LM response on NTLM version
2 systems.
</li>
<li>
NTLM2 Session Response - Used when NTLM2 session security is negotiated without
NTLMv2 authentication, this scheme alters the semantics of both the LM and
NTLM responses.
</li>
<li>
Anonymous Response - This is used when an anonymous context is being
established; actual credentials are not presented, and no true authentication
takes place.  "Stub" fields are presented in the Type 3 message.
</li>
</ul>
For more information on these schemes, it is highly recommended that
you read Christopher Hertel's
<a href="http://ubiqx.org/cifs"><i>Implementing CIFS</i></a>, especially
<a href="http://ubiqx.org/cifs/SMB.html#SMB.8">the section on authentication</a>.
<p>
The responses serve as an indirect proof of knowledge of the password.  The
password is used by the client to derive the LM and/or NTLM hash (discussed in the next section); these values are in turn used to calculate an appropriate
response to the challenge.  The domain controller (or server for local machine
accounts) stores the LM and NTLM hashes for the password; when the response
is received from the client, these stored values are used to calculate the
appropriate response values which are compared to those sent by the client.
A match yields a successful authentication of the user.
<p>
Note that unlike Unix password hashes, the LM and NTLM hash are
password-equivalents in the context of the response calculations; they must be
protected, as they can be used to authenticate users across the network even
without knowledge of the actual password itself.

<a name="theLmResponse">
<h4>The LM Response</h4>
<p>
The LM response is sent by most clients.  This scheme is older than
the NTLM response, and less secure.  While newer clients support the NTLM
response, they typically send both responses for compatibility with legacy
servers; hence, the security flaws present in the LM response are
still exhibited in many clients supporting the NTLM response.
<p>
The LM response is calculated as follows (see <a href="#getLMResponse">Appendix D</a> for a sample implementation in Java):
<ol>
<li>
The user's password (as an OEM string) is converted to uppercase.
</li>
<li>
This password is null-padded to 14 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This "fixed" password is split into two 7-byte halves.
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create two DES keys (one from each 7-byte half).
</li>
<li>
Each of these keys is used to DES-encrypt the constant ASCII string
"<tt>KGS!@#$%</tt>" (resulting in two 8-byte ciphertext values).
</li>
<li>
These two ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 16-byte value -
the LM hash.
</li>
<li>
The 16-byte LM hash is null-padded to 21 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds.
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create three DES keys (one from each 7-byte third).
</li>
<li>
Each of these keys is used to DES-encrypt the challenge from the Type 2 message
(resulting in three 8-byte ciphertext values).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 24-byte value.
This is the LM response.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the event that the user's password is longer than 15 characters, the host
or domain controller will not store the LM hash for the user; the LM response
cannot be used to authenticate the user in this case.  A response is still
generated and placed in the LM Response field, using a 16-byte null value
(<tt>0x00000000000000000000000000000000</tt>) as the LM hash in the
calculation.  This value is ignored by the target.
<p>
The response calculation process is best illustrated with a detailed example.
Consider a user with the password "<tt>SecREt01</tt>", responding to the Type 2
challenge "<tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt>".
<ol>
<li>
The password (as an OEM string) is converted to uppercase, giving
"<tt>SECRET01</tt>" (or "<tt>0x5345435245543031</tt>" in hexadecimal).
</li>
<li>
This password is null-padded to 14 bytes, giving
"<tt>0x5345435245543031000000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is split into two 7-byte halves, "<tt>0x53454352455430</tt>" and
"<tt>0x31000000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
These two values are used to create two DES keys.  A DES key is 8 bytes long;
each byte contains seven bits of key material and one odd-parity bit
(the parity bit may or may not be checked, depending on the underlying DES
implementation).  Our first 7-byte value, "<tt>0x53454352455430</tt>",
would be represented in binary as:
<p>
<tt>01010011 01000101 01000011 01010010 01000101 01010100 00110000</tt>
<p>
A non-parity-adjusted DES key for this value would be:
<p>
<tt>
    0101001<font color="red">0</font> 1010001<font color="red">0</font>
    0101000<font color="red">0</font> 0110101<font color="red">0</font>
    0010010<font color="red">0</font> 0010101<font color="red">0</font>
    0101000<font color="red">0</font> 0110000<font color="red">0</font>
</tt>
<p>
(the parity bits are shown in red above).  This is "<tt>0x52a2506a242a5060</tt>"
in hexadecimal.  Applying odd-parity to ensure that the total number of set
bits in each octet is odd gives:
<p>
<tt>
    0101001<font color="red">0</font> 1010001<font color="red">0</font>
    0101000<font color="red">1</font> 0110101<font color="red">1</font>
    0010010<font color="red">1</font> 0010101<font color="red">0</font>
    0101000<font color="red">1</font> 0110000<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
This is the first DES key ("<tt>0x52a2516b252a5161</tt>" in hex).  We then
apply the same process to our second 7-byte value, "<tt>0x31000000000000</tt>",
represented in binary as:
<p>
<tt>00110001 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</tt>
<p>
Creating a non-parity-adjusted DES key gives:
<p>
<tt>
    0011000<font color="red">0</font> 1000000<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">0</font> 0000000<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">0</font> 0000000<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">0</font> 0000000<font color="red">0</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0x3080000000000000</tt>" in hexadecimal).  Adjusting the parity bits
gives:
<p>
<tt>
    0011000<font color="red">1</font> 1000000<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
This is our second DES key, "<tt>0x3180010101010101</tt>" in hexadecimal.
Note that if our particular DES implementation does not enforce parity
(many do not), the parity-adjustment steps can be skipped; the
non-parity-adjusted values would then be used as the DES keys.  In any
case, the parity bits will not affect the encryption process.
</li>
<li>
Each of our keys is used to DES-encrypt the constant ASCII string
"<tt>KGS!@#$%</tt>" ("<tt>0x4b47532140232425</tt>" in hex).  This gives us
"<tt>0xff3750bcc2b22412</tt>" (using the first key) and
"<tt>0xc2265b23734e0dac</tt>" (using the second).
</li>
<li>
These ciphertext values are concatenated to form our 16-byte LM hash -
"<tt>0xff3750bcc2b22412c2265b23734e0dac</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This is null-padded to 21 bytes, giving
"<tt>0xff3750bcc2b22412c2265b23734e0dac0000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds, "<tt>0xff3750bcc2b224</tt>",
"<tt>0x12c2265b23734e</tt>" and "<tt>0x0dac0000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
These three values are used to create three DES keys.  Using the process
outlined previously, our first value:
<p>
<tt>11111111 00110111 01010000 10111100 11000010 10110010 00100100</tt>
<p>
Gives us the parity-adjusted DES key:
<p>
<tt>
    1111111<font color="red">0</font> 1001101<font color="red">1</font>
    1101010<font color="red">1</font> 0001011<font color="red">0</font>
    1100110<font color="red">1</font> 0001010<font color="red">1</font>
    1100100<font color="red">0</font> 0100100<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0xfe9bd516cd15c849</tt>" in hexadecimal).  The second value:
<p>
<tt>00010010 11000010 00100110 01011011 00100011 01110011 01001110</tt>
<p>
Results in the key:
<p>
<tt>
    0001001<font color="red">1</font> 0110000<font color="red">1</font>
    1000100<font color="red">1</font> 1100101<font color="red">1</font>
    1011001<font color="red">1</font> 0001101<font color="red">0</font>
    1100110<font color="red">1</font> 1001110<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0x136189cbb31acd9d</tt>").  Finally, the third value:
<p>
<tt>00001101 10101100 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</tt>
<p>
Gives us:
<p>
<tt>
    0000110<font color="red">1</font> 1101011<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
This is the third DES key ("<tt>0x0dd6010101010101</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Each of the three keys is used to DES-encrypt the challenge from the Type 2
message (in our example, "<tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt>").  This gives the
results "<tt>0xc337cd5cbd44fc97</tt>" (using the first key),
"<tt>0x82a667af6d427c6d</tt>" (using the second) and
"<tt>0xe67c20c2d3e77c56</tt>" (using the third).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form the 24-byte
LM response:
<p>
<tt><b>0xc337cd5cbd44fc9782a667af6d427c6de67c20c2d3e77c56</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are several weaknesses in this algorithm which make it susceptible to
attack.  While these are covered in detail in the Hertel text, the most
prominent problems are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Passwords are converted to upper case before calculating the response.
This significantly reduces the set of possible passwords that must be tested
in a brute-force attack.
</li>
<li>
If the password is seven or fewer characters, the second value from step 3
above will be 7 null bytes.  This effectively compromises half of the
LM hash (as it will always be the ciphertext of "<tt>KGS!@#$%</tt>"
encrypted with the DES key "<tt>0x0101010101010101</tt>" - the constant
"<tt>0xaad3b435b51404ee</tt>").  This in turn compromises the three DES keys
used to produce the response; the entire third key and all but one byte of the
second will be known constant values.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="theNtlmResponse">
<h4>The NTLM Response</h4>
<p>
The NTLM response is sent by newer clients.  This scheme addresses some of the
flaws in the LM response; however, it is still considered fairly
weak.  Additionally, the NTLM response is nearly always sent in conjunction with
the LM response.  The weaknesses in that algorithm can be exploited
to obtain the case-insensitive password, and trial-and-error used to find
the case-sensitive password employed by the NTLM response.
<p>
The NTLM response is calculated as follows (see <a href="#getNTLMResponse">Appendix D</a> for a sample Java implementation):
<ol>
<li>
The MD4 message-digest algorithm (described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1320.txt">RFC 1320</a>) is applied to the
Unicode mixed-case password.  This results in a 16-byte value - the NTLM hash.
</li>
<li>
The 16-byte NTLM hash is null-padded to 21 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds.
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create three DES keys (one from each 7-byte third).
</li>
<li>
Each of these keys is used to DES-encrypt the challenge from the Type 2
message (resulting in three 8-byte ciphertext values).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 24-byte value.
This is the NTLM response.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that only the calculation of the hash value differs from the LM
scheme; the response calculation is the same.  To illustrate this
process, we will apply it to our previous example (a user with the password
"<tt>SecREt01</tt>", responding to the Type 2 challenge
"<tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt>").
<ol>
<li>
The Unicode mixed-case password is "<tt>0x53006500630052004500740030003100</tt>"
in hexadecimal; the MD4 hash of this value is calculated, giving
"<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c99b1d33b7485a2ed808</tt>".  This is the NTLM hash.
</li>
<li>
This is null-padded to 21 bytes, giving
"<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c99b1d33b7485a2ed8080000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds, "<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c9</tt>",
"<tt>0x9b1d33b7485a2e</tt>" and "<tt>0xd8080000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
These three values are used to create three DES keys.  Our first value:
<p>
<tt>11001101 00000110 11001010 01111100 01111110 00010000 11001001</tt>
<p>
Results in the parity-adjusted key:
<p>
<tt>
    1100110<font color="red">1</font> 1000001<font color="red">1</font>
    1011001<font color="red">1</font> 0100111<font color="red">1</font>
    1100011<font color="red">1</font> 1111000<font color="red">1</font>
    0100001<font color="red">1</font> 1001001<font color="red">0</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0xcd83b34fc7f14392</tt>" in hexadecimal).  The second value:
<p>
<tt>10011011 00011101 00110011 10110111 01001000 01011010 00101110</tt>
<p>
Gives the key:
<p>
<tt>
    1001101<font color="red">1</font> 1000111<font color="red">1</font>
    0100110<font color="red">0</font> 0111011<font color="red">0</font>
    0111010<font color="red">1</font> 0100001<font color="red">1</font>
    0110100<font color="red">0</font> 0101110<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0x9b8f4c767543685d</tt>").  Our third value:
<p>
<tt>11011000 00001000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</tt>
<p>
Yields our third key:
<p>
<tt>
    1101100<font color="red">1</font> 0000010<font color="red">0</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
    0000000<font color="red">1</font> 0000000<font color="red">1</font>
</tt>
<p>
("<tt>0xd904010101010101</tt>" in hexadecimal).
</li>
<li>
Each of the three keys is used to DES-encrypt the challenge from the Type 2
message ("<tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt>").  This yields the results
"<tt>0x25a98c1c31e81847</tt>" (using our first key),
"<tt>0x466b29b2df4680f3</tt>" (using the second) and
"<tt>0x9958fb8c213a9cc6</tt>" (using the third key).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form the 24-byte NTLM
response:
<p>
<tt><b>0x25a98c1c31e81847466b29b2df4680f39958fb8c213a9cc6</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="theNtlmv2Response">
<h4>The NTLMv2 Response</h4>
<p>
NTLM version 2 ("NTLMv2") was concocted to address the security issues
present in NTLM.  When NTLMv2 is enabled, the NTLM response is replaced with
the NTLMv2 response, and the LM response is replaced with the LMv2 response
(which we will discuss next).
<p>
The NTLMv2 response is calculated as follows (see <a href="#getNTLMv2Response">Appendix D</a> for a sample implementation in Java):
<ol>
<li>
The NTLM password hash is obtained (as discussed previously, this is the
MD4 digest of the Unicode mixed-case password).
</li>
<li>
The Unicode uppercase username is concatenated with the Unicode 
authentication target (the domain or server name specified in the Target Name
field of the Type 3 message).  Note that this calculation always uses
the Unicode representation, even if OEM encoding has been negotiated; also note
that the username is converted to uppercase, while the authentication target is
case-sensitive and must match the case presented in the Target Name field.<br>
The HMAC-MD5 message authentication code algorithm (described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt">RFC 2104</a>) is applied to this
value using the 16-byte NTLM hash as the key.  This results in a 16-byte
value - the NTLMv2 hash.
</li>
<li>
A block of data known as the "blob" is constructed.  The Hertel text discusses
the format of this structure in greater detail; briefly:
<table cellpadding="5">

    <td>4 bytes</td>

</table>
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the blob.
The HMAC-MD5 message authentication code algorithm is applied to this value
using the 16-byte NTLMv2 hash (calculated in step 2) as the key.  This
results in a 16-byte output value.
</li>
<li>
This value is concatenated with the blob to form the NTLMv2 response.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Let's look at an example.  Since we need a bit more information to calculate
the NTLMv2 response, we will use the following values from the examples
presented previously:

The Unicode uppercase username is concatenated with the Unicode
authentication target, giving "<tt>USERDOMAIN</tt>" (or
"<tt>0x550053004500520044004f004d00410049004e00</tt>" in hexadecimal).
HMAC-MD5 is applied to this value using the 16-byte NTLM hash from the
previous step as the key, which yields
"<tt>0x04b8e0ba74289cc540826bab1dee63ae</tt>".  This is the NTLMv2 hash.
</li>
<li>
Next, the blob is constructed.  The timestamp is the most tedious part of
this; looking at the clock on my desk, it's about 6:00 AM EDT on June 17th,
2003.  In Unix time, that would be 1055844000 seconds after the Epoch.
Adding 11644473600 will give us seconds after January 1, 1601 (12700317600).
Multiplying by 10<sup>7</sup> (10000000) will give us tenths of a microsecond
(127003176000000000).  As a little-endian 64-bit value, this is
"<tt>0x0090d336b734c301</tt>" (in hexadecimal).
<p>
We also need to generate an 8-byte random "client nonce"; we will use the
not-so-random "<tt>0xffffff0011223344</tt>".  Constructing the rest of the
blob is easy; we just concatenate:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <td><tt>0x01010000</tt></td><td>(the blob signature)</td>

</table>
</li>
<li>
We then concatenate the Type 2 challenge with our blob:
<pre>
0x0123456789abcdef0101000000000000
  0090d336b734c301ffffff0011223344

<p>
Applying HMAC-MD5 to this value using the NTLMv2 hash from step 2 as the key
gives us the 16-byte value "<tt>0xcbabbca713eb795d04c97abc01ee4983</tt>".

<a name="theLmv2Response">
<h4>The LMv2 Response</h4>
<p>
The LMv2 response is used to provide pass-through authentication compatibility
with older servers.  It is quite possible that the server with which the
client is communicating will not actually perform the authentication; rather,
it will pass the responses through to a domain controller for verification.
Older servers pass only the LM response, and expect it to be exactly 24 bytes.
The LMv2 response was designed to allow such servers to operate properly;
it is effectively a "miniature" NTLMv2 response, obtained as follows
(see <a href="#getLMv2Response">Appendix D</a> for a sample Java
implementation):
<ol>
<li>
The NTLM password hash is calculated (the MD4 digest of the Unicode mixed-case
password).
</li>
<li>
The Unicode uppercase username is concatenated with the Unicode
authentication target (domain or server name) presented in the Target Name
field of the Type 3 message.  The HMAC-MD5 message authentication code
algorithm is applied to this value using the 16-byte NTLM hash as the key.
This results in a 16-byte value - the NTLMv2 hash.
</li>
<li>
A random 8-byte client nonce is created (this is the same client nonce
used in the NTLMv2 blob).
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the client
nonce.  The HMAC-MD5 message authentication code algorithm is applied to
this value using the 16-byte NTLMv2 hash (calculated in step 2) as the key.
This results in a 16-byte output value.
</li>
<li>
This value is concatenated with the 8-byte client nonce to form the
24-byte LMv2 response.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We will illustrate this process with a brief example using our tried-and-true
sample values:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <td align="right">Target:</td>
    <td><tt>DOMAIN</tt></td>

<tr valign="top">

<tr valign="top">
    <td align="right">Challenge:</td>
    <td><tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<ol>
<li>
The Unicode mixed-case password is "<tt>0x53006500630052004500740030003100</tt>"
in hexadecimal; the MD4 hash of this value is calculated, giving
"<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c99b1d33b7485a2ed808</tt>".  This is the NTLM hash.
</li>
<li>
The Unicode uppercase username is concatenated with the Unicode
authentication target, giving "<tt>USERDOMAIN</tt>" (or
"<tt>0x550053004500520044004f004d00410049004e00</tt>" in hexadecimal).
HMAC-MD5 is applied to this value using the 16-byte NTLM hash from the
previous step as the key, which yields
"<tt>0x04b8e0ba74289cc540826bab1dee63ae</tt>".  This is the NTLMv2 hash.
</li>
<li>
A random 8-byte client nonce is created.  From our NTLMv2 example, we will
use "<tt>0xffffff0011223344</tt>".
</li>
<li>
We then concatenate the Type 2 challenge with our client nonce:
<p>
<tt>0x0123456789abcdefffffff0011223344</tt>
<p>
Applying HMAC-MD5 to this value using the NTLMv2 hash from step 2 as the key
gives us the 16-byte value "<tt>0xd6e6152ea25d03b7c6ba6629c2d6aaf0</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is concatenated with the client nonce to obtain the 24-byte
LMv2 response:
<p>
<tt><b>0xd6e6152ea25d03b7c6ba6629c2d6aaf0ffffff0011223344</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="theNtlm2SessionResponse">
<h4>The NTLM2 Session Response</h4>
<p>
The NTLM2 session response can be employed in conjunction with NTLM2 session
security (it is made available with the "Negotiate NTLM2 Key" flag).  This
is used to provide enhanced protection against precomputed dictionary attacks
(particularly Rainbow Table-based attacks) in environments which do not support
full NTLMv2 authentication.
<p>
The NTLM2 session response replaces both the LM and NTLM response
fields as follows (see <a href="#getNTLM2SessionResponse">Appendix D</a> for a
sample implementation in Java):
<ol>
<li>
A random 8-byte client nonce is created.
</li>
<li>
The client nonce is null-padded to 24 bytes.  This value is placed in
the LM response field of the Type 3 message.
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the 8-byte client
nonce to form a session nonce.
</li>
<li>
The MD5 message-digest algorithm (described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt">RFC 1321</a>) is applied to
the session nonce, resulting in a 16-byte value.
</li>
<li>
This value is truncated to 8 bytes to form the NTLM2 session hash.
</li>
<li>
The NTLM password hash is obtained (as discussed, this is the MD4 digest of the
Unicode mixed-case password).
</li>
<li>
The 16-byte NTLM hash is null-padded to 21 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds.
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create three DES keys (one from each 7-byte third).
</li>
<li>
Each of these keys is used to DES-encrypt the NTLM2 session hash (resulting
in three 8-byte ciphertext values).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 24-byte value.  This
is the NTLM2 session response, which is placed in the NTLM response field of
the Type 3 message.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To demonstrate this with our previous example values (a user with the password
"<tt>SecREt01</tt>", responding to the Type 2 challenge
"<tt>0x0123456789abcdef</tt>"):
<ol>
<li>
A random 8-byte client nonce is created; we will use
"<tt>0xffffff0011223344</tt>", as in the previous examples.
</li>
<li>
The challenge is null-padded to 24 bytes:
<p>
<tt><b>0xffffff001122334400000000000000000000000000000000</b></tt>
<p>
This value is placed in the LM response field of the Type 3 message.
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the client
nonce, forming a session nonce
("<tt>0x0123456789abcdefffffff0011223344</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Applying the MD5 digest to this nonce yields the 16-byte value
"<tt>0xbeac9a1bc5a9867c15192b3105d5beb1</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This is truncated to 8 bytes to obtain the NTLM2 session hash
("<tt>0xbeac9a1bc5a9867c</tt>").
</li>
<li>
The Unicode mixed-case password is
"<tt>0x53006500630052004500740030003100</tt>";  applying the MD4 digest to
this value gives us the NTLM hash
("<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c99b1d33b7485a2ed808</tt>").
</li>
<li>
This is null-padded to 21 bytes, giving
"<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c99b1d33b7485a2ed8080000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is split into three 7-byte thirds, "<tt>0xcd06ca7c7e10c9</tt>",
"<tt>0x9b1d33b7485a2e</tt>" and "<tt>0xd8080000000000</tt>".
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create three DES keys (as calculated in our previous
NTLM response example, "<tt>0xcd83b34fc7f14392</tt>",
"<tt>0x9b8f4c767543685d</tt>", and "<tt>0xd904010101010101</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Each of these three keys is used to DES-encrypt the NTLM2 session hash
("<tt>0xbeac9a1bc5a9867c</tt>").  This yields the results
"<tt>0x10d550832d12b2cc</tt>" (using our first key),
"<tt>0xb79d5ad1f4eed3df</tt>" (using the second), and
"<tt>0x82aca4c3681dd455</tt>" (using the third key).
</li>
<li>
These three ciphertext values are concatenated to form the 24-byte
NTLM2 session response:
<p>
<tt><b>0x10d550832d12b2ccb79d5ad1f4eed3df82aca4c3681dd455</b></tt>
<p>
which is placed in the NTLM response field of the Type 3 message.
</li>
</ol>
<a name="theAnonymousResponse">
<h4>The Anonymous Response</h4>
<p>
The Anonymous Response is seen when the client is establishing an anonymous
context, rather than a true user-based context.  This is typically seen when
a "placeholder" is needed for operations that do not require an authenticated
user.  Anonymous connections are not the same as the Windows "Guest" user
(the latter is an actual user account, while anonymous connections are
associated with no account at all).
<p>
In an anonymous Type 3 message, the client indicates the "Negotiate Anonymous"
flag; the NTLM response field is empty (zero-length); and the LM response
field contains a single null byte ("<tt>0x00</tt>").

NTLM responses and compares them to the values provided by the client; if they
match, the user is successfully authenticated.

<a name="ntlmVersion2">
<h2>NTLM Version 2</h2>
<p>
NTLM version 2 consists of three new response algorithms (NTLMv2, LMv2, 
and the NTLM2 session response, discussed previously) and a new signing and
sealing scheme (NTLM2 session security).  NTLM2 session security is negotiated
via the "Negotiate NTLM2 Key" flag; NTLMv2 authentication, however, is enabled
through a modification to the registry.  Further, the registry setting on the
client and domain controller must be compatible in order for authentication to
be successful (although it is possible for NTLMv2 authentication to pass
through an older server to an NTLMv2 domain controller).  The result of the
configuration and planning required to deploy NTLMv2 is that many hosts just
use the default setting (NTLMv1), and NTLMv2 authentication is underutilized.
<p>
Instructions for enabling NTLM version 2 are detailed in
 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;239869">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 239869</a>; briefly, a modification is made to the
 registry value:

<p>

<p>
In all levels, NTLM2 session security is supported and negotiated when
available (most available documentation indicates that NTLM2 session security
is only enabled on levels 1 and above, but it is seen in practice with Level 0
as well).  By default, only the LM response is supported on Windows 95 and
Windows 98 platforms; installing the Directory Services client makes NTLMv2
available on these hosts as well (and enables the <tt>LMCompatibility</tt>
setting, although only levels 0 and 3 are available).
<p>
In Level 2, clients send the NTLM response twice (in both the LM and NTLM
response fields).  At Level 3 and higher, the LMv2 and NTLMv2 responses
replace the LM and NTLM responses, respectively.
<p>
When NTLM2 session security has been negotiated (indicated by the "Negotiate
NTLM2 Key" flag), the NTLM2 session response can be used in Levels 0, 1, and
2 as a replacement for the weaker LM and NTLM responses.  This offers
heightened protection over NTLMv1 against server-based precomputed dictionary
attacks; the client's response to a given challenge is made variable by adding a
random client nonce to the calculation.
<p>
The NTLM2 session response is interesting in that it can be negotiated between a
client and server that support the newer schemes, even in the presence of an
older domain controller that does not.  In a typical scenario, the
server in an authentication transaction does not actually possess the user's
password hash; that is instead held at the domain controller.  When a machine
is joined to an NT-style domain, it establishes an encrypted,
mutually-authenticated channel to the domain controller (colloquially deemed the
"NetLogon pipe").  When a client authenticates to the server using the "vanilla"
NTLMv1 handshake, the following transactions occur in the background:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The client sends the Type 1 message, containing flags and other information
as discussed previously.</li>
<li>The server generates a challenge for the client and sends the Type 2 message
containing the negotiated flag set.</li>
<li>The client responds to the challenge, providing the LM/NTLM responses.</li>
<li>The server sends the challenge and client responses over the NetLogon pipe
to the domain controller.</li>
<li>The domain controller uses the stored hashes and the challenge given by
the server to reproduce the authentication calculations; if they match the
responses, the authentication is successful.</li>
<li>The domain controller calculates and sends the session key to the server,
which can be used for subsequent signing and sealing operations between the
server and the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the case of the NTLM2 Session Response, it is possible that a client and
server have been upgraded to allow the newer protocol, but the domain controller
has not.  To allow for this contingency, the handshake described above is
modified slightly as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The client sends the Type 1 message, in this case indicating the "Negotiate
NTLM2 Key" flag.</li>
<li>The server generates a challenge for the client and sends the Type 2 message
containing the negotiated flag set (also including the "Negotiate NTLM2 Key"
flag).</li>
<li>The client responds to the challenge, providing the client nonce in the LM
field, and the NTLM2 Session Response in the NTLM field.  Note that the latter
is exactly the same calculation as the NTLM response, except instead of
encrypting the server challenge the client has encrypted the MD5 hash of the
server challenge concatenated with the client nonce.</li>
<li>Instead of sending the server challenge directly over the NetLogon pipe to
the domain controller, the server sends the MD5 hash of the server challenge
concatenated with the client nonce (lifted from the LM response field).
Additionally it sends the client responses (as usual).</li>
<li>The domain controller encrypts the challenge field sent by the server using
the stored hash as the key and notes that it matches the NTLM response field;
hence, the client is successfully authenticated.</li>
<li>The domain controller calculates and sends the normal NTLM User Session
Key to the server; the server uses this in a secondary calculation to obtain
the NTLM2 Session Response User Session Key (discussed in a
<a href="#theNtlm2SessionResponseUserSessionKey">subsequent section</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Essentially, this allows upgraded clients and servers to use the NTLM2 Session
Response in networks where the domain controller has not yet been upgraded to
NTLMv2 (or where the network administrator has not yet configured the
<tt>LMCompatibilityLevel</tt> registry setting to use NTLMv2).
<p>
Related to the <tt>LMCompatibilityLevel</tt> setting are the
<tt>NtlmMinClientSec</tt> and <tt>NtlmMinServerSec</tt> settings; these specify
minimum requirements for NTLM contexts established by the NTLMSSP.  Both are
<tt>REG_WORD</tt> entries, and are bitfields specifying a combination of the
following NTLM flags:
<ul>
<li>Negotiate Sign (<tt>0x00000010</tt>) - Indicates the context must be
established with support for message integrity (signing).</li>
<li>Negotiate Seal (<tt>0x00000020</tt>) - Indicates the context must be
established with support for message confidentiality (sealing).</li>
<li>Negotiate NTLM2 Key (<tt>0x00080000</tt>) - Indicates the context
must be established with NTLM2 session security.</li>
<li>Negotiate 128 (<tt>0x20000000</tt>) - Indicates the context must support
at least 128-bit signing/sealing keys.</li>
<li>Negotiate 56 (<tt>0x80000000</tt>) - Indicates the context must support
at least 56-bit signing/sealing keys.</li>
</ul>
While most of these are more applicable to NTLM2 signing and sealing, the
"Negotiate NTLM2 Key" is significant to authentication in that it can prevent
sessions from being established with hosts that are unable to negotiate
NTLM2 session security.  This serves to ensure that the LM and NTLM responses
are not sent (requiring that authentication will at least use the NTLM2
Session Response in all cases).

<a name="ntlmsspAndSspi">
<h2>NTLMSSP and SSPI</h2>
<p>
At this point, we will start to look at how NTLM fits into the "big picture".
<p>
Windows provides a security framework known as SSPI - the Security Support
Provider interface.  This is the Microsoft equivalent of the GSS-API
(Generic Security Service Application Program Interface,
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt">RFC 2743</a>), and allows for a
very high-level, mechanism-independent means of applying authentication,
integrity, and confidentiality primitives.  SSPI supports several underlying
providers; one of these is the NTLMSSP (NTLM Security Support Provider), which
provides the NTLM authentication mechanism we have been discussing thus far.
SSPI supplies a flexible API for handling opaque, provider-specific
authentication tokens; the NTLM Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3
messages are such tokens, specific to and processed by the NTLMSSP.  The API
provided by SSPI abstracts away almost all the details of NTLM.  The application
developer doesn't even have to be aware that NTLM is being used, and another
authentication mechanism (such as Kerberos) can be swapped in with little or
no changes at the application level.
<p>
We aren't going to delve too deeply into the SSPI framework, but this is a good
point to look at the SSPI authentication handshake as applied to NTLM:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The client obtains a representation of the credential set for the user via the
 SSPI <tt>AcquireCredentialsHandle</tt> function.
</li>
<li>
The client calls the SSPI <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> function to
obtain an authentication request token (in our case, a Type 1 message).
The client sends this token to the server.  The return value from
the function indicates that authentication will require multiple steps.
</li>
<li>
The server receives the token from the client, and uses it as input to the
<tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> SSPI function.  This creates a local security
 context on the server to represent the client, and yields an authentication
response token (the Type 2 message), which is sent to the client.  The
 return value from the function indicates that further information
 is needed from the client.
</li>
<li>
The client receives the response token from the server and calls
<tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> again, passing the server's token as
input.  This provides us with another authentication request token
 (the Type 3 message).  The return value indicates that the security context
was successfully initialized; the token is sent to the server.
</li>
<li>
The server receives the token from the client and calls
<tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> again, using the Type 3 message as input.
The return value indicates the context was successfully accepted; no token
is produced, and authentication is complete.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="localAuthentication">
<h3>Local Authentication</h3>
<p>
We have alluded to the local authentication sequence at various points in
our discussion; having a basic understanding of SSPI, we can look at this
scenario in more detail.
<p>
Local authentication is negotiated through a series of decisions made by the
client and server, based on the information in the NTLM messages.  It works as
follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The client calls the <tt>AcquireCredentialsHandle</tt> function, specifying the
default credentials by passing in null to the "pAuthData" parameter.  This
obtains a handle to the credentials of the logged in user for single sign-on.
</li>
<li>
The client calls the SSPI <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> function to
create the Type 1 message.  When the default credential handle is supplied,
the Type 1 message contains the workstation and domain name of the client.
This is indicated by the presence of the "Negotiate Domain Supplied" and
"Negotiate Workstation Supplied" flags, and the inclusion of populated
Supplied Domain and Supplied Workstation security buffers in the message.
</li>
<li>
The server receives the Type 1 message from the client, and calls
<tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt>.  This creates a local security
 context on the server to represent the client.  The server examines the domain
and workstation information sent by the client to determine if the client and
server are the same machine.  If so, the server initiates local authentication
by setting the "Negotiate Local Call" flag in the resultant Type 2 message.
The first <tt>long</tt> in the Context field of the Type 2 message is
populated with the "upper" portion of the newly obtained SSPI context handle
(specifically, the "dwUpper" field of the SSPI <tt>CtxtHandle</tt> structure).
The second <tt>long</tt> in the Context field appears to be empty in all
cases. (although logically one would assume it should contain the "lower"
portion of the context handle).
</li>
<li>
The client receives the Type 2 message from the server and passes it to
<tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt>.  Having noted the presence of the
"Negotiate Local Call" flag, the client examines the server context handle
to determine if it represents a valid local security context.  If the context
cannot be validated, authentication proceeds as usual - the appropriate
responses are calculated, and included with the domain, workstation, and
username in the Type 3 message.  If the security context handle from the
Type 2 message <i>can</i> be validated, however, no responses are
 prepared whatsoever.  Instead, the default credentials are internally
 associated with the server context.  The resulting Type 3 message is
 completely empty, containing zero-length security buffers for the responses
as well as the username, domain, and workstation.
</li>
<li>
The server receives the Type 3 message and uses it as input to the
<tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> function.  The server verifies that the
security context has been associated with a user; if so, authentication
has successfully completed.  If the context has not been bound to a user,
authentication fails.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="datagramAuthentication">
<h3>Datagram Authentication</h3>
<p>
Datagram-style authentication is used to negotiate NTLM over a connectionless
transport.  While much of the semantics around the messages remain unchanged,
 there are a few significant differences:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
SSPI does not create a Type 1 message during the first call to
<tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Authentication options are offered by the server, rather than requested by
the client.
</li>
<li>
Rather than being superfluous (as in connection-oriented authentication),
the flags in the Type 3 message carry their usual meanings.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
During "normal" (connection-oriented) authentication, all options are
 negotiated in the first transaction between the client and the server, during
 the exchange of the Type 1 and Type 2 messages.  The negotiated settings are
 "remembered" by the server and applied to the client's Type 3 message.
  Although most clients send the agreed-upon flags with the Type 3 message,
 they are not used in connection authentication.
<p>
In datagram authentication, however, the game changes a bit; to alleviate the
server's need to track the negotiated options (which becomes more difficult
without a persistent connection), the Type 1 message is removed completely.
  The server generates a Type 2 message containing all supported flags
 (as well as the challenge, of course).  The client then decides which options
 it will support, and replies with a Type 3 message containing the responses
 to the challenge and the set of selected flags.  The SSPI handshake sequence
 for datagram authentication is as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The client calls <tt>AcquireCredentialsHandle</tt> to obtain a representation
of the credential set for the user.
</li>
<li>
The client calls <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt>, passing the
<tt>ISC_REQ_DATAGRAM</tt> flag as a context requirement via the
fContextReq parameter.  This starts the construction of the client's security
context, but does <i>not</i> produce a request token (Type 1 message).
</li>
<li>
The server calls the <tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> function, specifying the
<tt>ASC_REQ_DATAGRAM</tt> context requirement flag and passing in a null
input token.  This creates the local security context and yields an
authentication response token (the Type 2 message).  This Type 2 message
will contain the "Negotiate Datagram Style" flag, as well as all flags
supported by the server.  This is sent to the client as usual.
</li>
<li>
The client receives the Type 2 message and passes it to
<tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt>.  The client selects appropriate options
from those presented by the server (including "Negotiate Datagram Style",
which must be set), creates the responses to the challenge, and populates the
Type 3 message.  The message is then relayed to the server.
</li>
<li>
The server passes the Type 3 message into the <tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt>
function.  The message is processed according to the flags selected by the
client, and the context is successfully accepted.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When used with SSPI, there is apparently no means of producing a datagram-style
Type 1 message.  It is interesting to note, however, that we can "induce"
datagram semantics at a lower level by subtly manipulating the NTLMSSP tokens
to produce our own datagram Type 1 token.
<p>
This can be achieved by setting the "Negotiate Datagram Style" flag on the
Type 1 message produced by the first <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> call
in a connection-oriented SSPI handshake before passing the token to the server.
When the modified Type 1 message is passed into the
 <tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> function, the server will adopt datagram
semantics (even though <tt>ASC_REQ_DATAGRAM</tt> was not specified).  This
will produce a Type 2 message with the "Negotiate Datagram Style" flag set,
but otherwise identical to the connection-oriented message that would normally
have been generated; that is, the Type 1 flags sent by the client are
considered during the construction of the Type 2 message, rather than simply
offering all supported options.
<p>
The client can then call <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> with this Type 2
token.  Note that the client is still in connection-oriented mode; the Type 3
message produced will ignore the "Negotiate Datagram Style" flag applied to the
Type 2 message.  The server, however, is enforcing datagram semantics, and
will now require the Type 3 flags to be set appropriately.  Adding the
"Negotiate Datagram Style" flag to the Type 3 message manually before 
sending it to the server allows the server to successfully call
<tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> with the modified token.
<p>
This results in successful authentication; the "doctored" Type 1 message
effectively switches the server into datagram-style authentication, in
which the Type 3 flags are observed and enforced.  There is no known practical
use for this, but it does demonstrate some of the interesting and unexpected
behavior that can be observed by strategically manipulating the NTLM messages.

<a name="sessionSecurityConcepts">
<h2>Session Security - Signing &amp; Sealing Concepts</h2>
<p>
In addition to the SSPI authentication services, message integrity and
confidentiality functionality is provided.  This is also implemented by the
NTLM Security Support Provider.  "Signing" is performed by the SSPI
<tt>MakeSignature</tt> function, which applies a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) to a message.  This can be verified by the recipient, and provides a
strong assurance that the message was not modified in transit.  The signature
is generated using a secret key, known to the sender and receiver; the MAC
can only be verified by a party possessing the key (which in turn provides
assurance that the signature was created by the sender).  "Sealing" is
performed by the SSPI <tt>EncryptMessage</tt> function.  This applies
encryption to a message to prevent it from being viewed by a third party
in transit; the NTLMSSP uses a variety of symmetric encryption mechanisms
(the same key is used to decrypt as to encrypt).
<p>
The keys used in signing and sealing are established as a by-product of
the NTLM authentication process; in addition to verifying a client's
identity, the authentication handshake establishes a context between the
client and server which includes the key(s) needed to sign and seal
messages between the parties.  We will discuss the derivation of these keys,
and the mechanisms used for signing and sealing by the NTLMSSP.
<p>
There are numerous key schemes employed during signing and sealing; we will
start with an overview of the different types of keys and core session security
concepts.

<a name="theUserSessionKey">
<h3>The User Session Key</h3>
<p>
This is the basic key type employed in session security.  There are
many variants:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The LM User Session Key</li>
<li>The NTLM User Session Key</li>
<li>The LMv2 User Session Key</li>
<li>The NTLMv2 User Session Key</li>
<li>The NTLM2 Session Response User Session Key</li>
</ul>

The method of derivation used depends on the responses sent in the Type 3
message.  These variants and their calculations are outlined below.

<a name="theLmUserSessionKey">
<h4>The LM User Session Key</h4>
<p>
Used when only the LM response is provided (i.e., with Win9x clients).  The
LM User Session Key is derived as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The 16-byte LM hash (calculated previously) is truncated to 8 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This is null-padded to 16 bytes.  This value is the LM User Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As with the LM hash itself, this key only changes in response to a change of
password by the user.  Note also that only the first 7 password characters have
input to the key (see the process for computing the
<a href="#theLmResponse">LM Response</a>; the LM User Session Key is the
first half of the LM hash).  Additionally, the keyspace is actually much
smaller, as the LM hash itself is based on the uppercase password.  All of
these factors combined render the LM User Session Key very weak against attack.

<a name="theNtlmUserSessionKey">
<h4>The NTLM User Session Key</h4>
<p>
This variant is used when the client sends the NTLM response.  The calculation
of the key is fairly straightforward:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The NTLM hash is obtained (the MD4 digest of the Unicode mixed-case
password, calculated previously).
</li>
<li>
The MD4 message-digest algorithm is applied to the NTLM hash, resulting in
a 16-byte value.  This is the NTLM User Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The NTLM User Session Key is much improved over the LM User Session Key.  The
password space is larger (it is case-sensitive, rather than converting the
password to uppercase); additionally, all password characters have input in
the key generation.  However, it is still only changed when the user changes
his or her password; this makes offline attacks much easier.

<a name="theLmv2UserSessionKey">
<h4>The LMv2 User Session Key</h4>
<p>
Used when the LMv2 response is sent (but not the NTLMv2 response).  Deriving
this key is a bit more complicated, but not terribly complex:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The NTLMv2 hash is obtained (as calculated previously).
</li>
<li>
The LMv2 client nonce is obtained (used in the LMv2 response).
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the client
nonce.  The HMAC-MD5 message authentication code algorithm is applied to
this value using the NTLMv2 hash as the key, resulting in a 16-byte output
value.
</li>
<li>
The HMAC-MD5 algorithm is applied to this value, again using the NTLMv2
hash as the key.  The resulting 16-byte value is the LMv2 User Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The LMv2 User Session Key offers several improvements over the NTLMv1-based
keys.  It is derived from the NTLMv2 hash (itself derived from the NTLM hash),
which is specific to the username and domain/server; additionally, both the
server challenge and client nonce provide input to the key calculation.  The
key calculation can also be stated simply as the HMAC-MD5 digest of the first
16 bytes of the LMv2 response (using the NTLMv2 hash as the key).

<a name="theNtlmv2UserSessionKey">
<h4>The NTLMv2 User Session Key</h4>
<p>
Used when the NTLMv2 response is sent.  Calculation of this key is very similar
to the LMv2 User Session Key:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The NTLMv2 hash is obtained (as calculated previously).
</li>
<li>
The NTLMv2 "blob" is obtained (as used in the NTLMv2 response).
</li>
<li>
The challenge from the Type 2 message is concatenated with the blob.  The
HMAC-MD5 message authentication code algorithm is applied to this value using
the NTLMv2 hash as the key, resulting in a 16-byte output value.
</li>
<li>
The HMAC-MD5 algorithm is applied to this value, again using the NTLMv2
hash as the key.  The resulting 16-byte value is the NTLMv2 User Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The NTLMv2 User Session Key is quite similar cryptographically to the LMv2
User Session Key.  It can be stated as the HMAC-MD5 digest of the first 16
bytes of the NTLMv2 response (using the NTLMv2 hash as the key).

<a name="theNtlm2SessionResponseUserSessionKey">
<h4>The NTLM2 Session Response User Session Key</h4>
<p>
Used when NTLMv1 authentication is employed with NTLM2 session security.
This key is derived from the NTLM2 session response information as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The NTLM User Session Key is obtained as outlined previously.
</li>
<li>
The session nonce is obtained (discussed previously, this is the
concatenation of the Type 2 challenge and the nonce from the NTLM2
session response).
</li>
<li>
The HMAC-MD5 algorithm is applied to the session nonce, using the NTLM
User Session Key as the key.  The resulting 16-byte value is the NTLM2 Session 
Response User Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The NTLM2 Session Response User Session Key is notable in that it is calculated
between the client and server, rather than at the domain controller.  The
domain controller derives the NTLM User Session Key and supplies it to the
server, as before; if NTLM2 session security has been negotiated with the
client, the server then takes the HMAC-MD5 digest of the session nonce using
the NTLM User Session Key as the MAC key.

<a name="theNullUserSessionKey">
<h4>The Null User Session Key</h4>
<p>
The Null User Session Key is employed when Anonymous authentication is
performed.  This one is simple; it's just 16 null bytes ("<tt>0x00000000000000000000000000000000</tt>").

<a name="theLanManagerSessionKey">
<h3>The Lan Manager Session Key</h3>
<p>
The Lan Manager Session Key is an alternative to the User Session Keys, used
to derive keys in NTLM1 signing and sealing when the "Negotiate Lan Manager
Key" NTLM flag is set.  Calculation of the Lan Manager Session Key is as
follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The 16-byte LM hash (calculated previously) is truncated to 8 bytes.
</li>
<li>
This is padded to 14 bytes with the value "<tt>0xbdbdbdbdbdbd</tt>".
</li>
<li>
This value is split into two 7-byte halves.
</li>
<li>
These values are used to create two DES keys (one from each 7-byte half).
</li>
<li>
Each of these keys is used to DES-encrypt the first 8 bytes of the LM
response (resulting in two 8-byte ciphertext values).
</li>
<li>
These two ciphertext values are concatenated to form a 16-byte value -
the Lan Manager Session Key.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that the Lan Manager Session Key is based on the LM response (rather
than simply the LM hash), which means that it will change in response to a
different server challenge.  This is an advantage over the LM and NTLM User
Session Keys, which are based solely on the password hash; the Lan Manager
Session Key changes for each authentication operation, while the LM/NTLM
User Session Keys remain the same until the user changes his or her password.
For this reason, the Lan Manager Session Key is a much stronger scheme than the
LM User Session Key (both have a similar key strength, but the Lan Manager
Session Key prevents against replay attacks).  The NTLM User Session Key has a
full 128-bit keyspace, but like the LM User Session Key does not vary on each
authentication.

<a name="keyExchange">
<h3>Key Exchange</h3>
<p>
When the "Negotiate Key Exchange" flag is negotiated, the client and server
will agree upon a "secondary" key, used instead of the session key for
signing and sealing.  This done as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The client selects a random 16-byte key (the secondary key).
</li>
<li>
The session key (either the User Session Key or Lan Manager Session Key,
depending on the state of the "Negotiate Lan Manager Key" flag) is used
to RC4-encrypt the secondary key.  This results in a 16-byte ciphertext value.
</li>
<li>
This value is sent to the server in the "Session Key" field of the
Type 3 message.
</li>
<li>
The server receives the Type 3 message and decrypts the value sent by
the client (using RC4 with the User Session Key or Lan Manager Session Key).
</li>
<li>
The resulting value is the recovered secondary key, and is used in
place of the session key for signing and sealing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additionally, the key exchange process subtly changes the signing protocol
in NTLM2 session security (discussed in a subsequent section).

<a name="keyWeakening">
<h3>Key Weakening</h3>
<p>
The key used for signing and sealing is "weakened" in accordance with
cryptographic export restrictions.  The key strength is determined by the
"Negotiate 128" and "Negotiate 56" flags.  The strength of the final key used
is the maximum strength supported by both the client and server; if neither
flag is set, the default key length of 40 bits is used.  NTLM1 signing and
sealing supports 40-bit and 56-bit keys; NTLM2 session security supports
40-bit, 56-bit, and unweakened 128-bit keys.

<a name="ntlm1SessionSecurity">
<h2>NTLM1 Session Security</h2>
<p>
NTLM1 is the "original" NTLMSSP signing and sealing scheme, used when the
"Negotiate NTLM2 Key" flag is not negotiated.  Key derivation in this scheme
is driven by the following NTLM flags:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
    <td nowrap>Negotiate Lan Manager Key</td>
    <td>
        When set, the Lan Manager Session Key is used as the basis for the
        signing and sealing keys (rather than the User Session Key).  If not
        established, the User Session Key will be used for key derivation.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td nowrap>Negotiate 56</td>
    <td>
        Indicates support for 56-bit keys.  If not negotiated, 40-bit keys will
        be used.  This is only applicable in combination with "Negotiate Lan
        Manager Key"; User Session Keys are not weakened under NTLM1 (as they
        are already weak).
    </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td nowrap>Negotiate Key Exchange</td>
    <td>

        key for signing and sealing.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="ntlm1KeyDerivation">
<h3>NTLM1 Key Derivation</h3>
<p>
Deriving NTLM1 keys is essentially a three-step process:
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Master key negotiation</li>
    <li>Key exchange</li>
    <li>Key weakening</li>
</ol>

<a name="ntlm1MasterKeyNegotiation">
<h4>Master Key Negotiation</h4>
<p>
The first step is negotiation of the 128-bit "master key" from which the final
signing and sealing key will be derived.  This is driven by the "Negotiate
Lan Manager Key" NTLM flag; if set, the Lan Manager Session Key will be used
as the master key.  Otherwise, the appropriate User Session Key is employed.
<p>
As an example, consider our example user with the password "SecREt01".  If
the "Negotiate Lan Manager" key is not set, and an NTLM response was provided
in the Type 3 message, the NTLM User Session Key will be selected as the
master key.  This is calculated by taking the MD4 digest of the NTLM hash
(which is itself the MD4 hash of the Unicode password):
<p>
<tt>0x3f373ea8e4af954f14faa506f8eebdc4</tt>
<p>

<a name="ntlm1KeyExchange">
<h4>Key Exchange</h4>
<p>
If the "Negotiate Key Exchange" flag is set, the client will populate the
"Session Key" field in the Type 3 message with a new master key, RC4-encrypted
with the previously selected master key.  The server will decrypt this value
to receive the new master key.
<p>
For example, assume that the client selects the random master key
"<tt>0xf0f0aabb00112233445566778899aabb</tt>".  The client will encrypt this
value using RC4 with the previously negotiated master key
("<tt>0x3f373ea8e4af954f14faa506f8eebdc4</tt>") to obtain the value:
<p>
<tt>0x1d3355eb71c82850a9a2d65c2952e6f3</tt>
<p>
This is sent to the server in the "Session Key" field of the Type 3 message.
The server RC4-decrypts this value using the old master key to recover the
new master key selected by the client
("<tt>0xf0f0aabb00112233445566778899aabb</tt>").

<a name="ntlm1KeyWeakening">
<h4>Key Weakening</h4>
<p>
Finally, the key is weakened to comply with export restrictions.  NTLM1
supports 40-bit and 56-bit keys.  If the "Negotiate 56" NTLM flag is set, the
128-bit master key will be weakened to 56-bits; otherwise, it will be
weakened to 40-bits.  Note that key weakening is only employed under NTLM1
when the Lan Manager Session Key is used ("Negotiate Lan Manager Key" is set).
The LM and NTLM User Session Keys are based on the password hashes, rather than
the responses; a given password will always result in the same User Session Key
under NTLM1.  Weakening was apparently not deemed necessary, since the
User Session Key can be easily recovered given a user's password hash.
<p>
The process for key weakening under NTLM1 is as follows:
<ul>
<li>
To produce a 56-bit key, the master key is truncated to 7 bytes (56 bits) and
the byte value "<tt>0xa0</tt>" is appended.
</li>
<li>
To produce a 40-bit key, the master key is truncated to 5 bytes (40 bits) and
the three-byte value "<tt>0xe538b0</tt>" is appended.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the master key "<tt>0x0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f00</tt>" as an
example, the 40-bit key used for signing and sealing would be
"<tt>0x0102030405e538b0</tt>".  If 56-bit keys are negotiated, the final key
would be "<tt>0x01020304050607a0</tt>".

<a name="ntlm1Signing">
<h3>Signing</h3>
<p>
Once the key has been negotiated it can be used to produce digital signatures,
providing message integrity.  Support for signing is indicated by the 
presence of the "Negotiate Sign" NTLM flag.
<p>
NTLM1 signing (as done by the SSPI <tt>MakeSignature</tt> function) is
performed as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized using the previously negotiated key.  This
is done once (before the first signing operation), and the keystream is never
reset.
</li>
<li>
The CRC32 checksum of the message is calculated; this is represented as a long
(32-bit little-endian value).
</li>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained; this starts at zero and is incremented after
each message is signed.  The number is represented as a long.
</li>
<li>
Four zero bytes are concatenated with the CRC32 value and sequence number
to obtain a 12-byte value ("<tt>0x00000000</tt>" + CRC32(message) +
sequenceNumber).
</li>
<li>
This value is encrypted using the previously initialized RC4 cipher.
</li>
<li>
The first four bytes of the ciphertext result are overwritten with a
pseudorandom counter value (the actual value used is insignificant).
</li>
<li>
A version number ("<tt>0x01000000</tt>") is concatenated with the result from
the previous step to form the signature.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As an example, assume that we are signing the message "<tt>jCIFS</tt>"
(hexadecimal "<tt>0x6a43494653</tt>") using the 40-bit key from the previous
example:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The CRC32 checksum is calculated (in little-endian hexadecimal,
"<tt>0xa0310bb7</tt>").
</li>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained.  Since this is the first message we have
signed, the sequence number is zero ("<tt>0x00000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Four zero bytes are concatenated with the CRC32 value and sequence number
to obtain a 12-byte value ("<tt>0x00000000a0310bb700000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
This value is RC4-encrypted using our key ("<tt>0x0102030405e538b0</tt>"); this
yields the ciphertext "<tt>0xecbf1ced397420fe0e5a0f89</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The first four bytes are overwritten with a counter value;
using "<tt>0x78010900</tt>" gives "<tt>0x78010900397420fe0e5a0f89</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The version stamp is concatenated with the result to form the final
signature:
<p>
<tt><b>0x0100000078010900397420fe0e5a0f89</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The next message signed would receive the sequence number 1; also, note again
that the RC4 keystream initialized with the first signing is not reset for
subsequent signatures.

<a name="ntlm1Sealing">
<h3>Sealing</h3>
<p>
In addition to message integrity, message confidentiality is provided via
sealing.  The "Negotiate Seal" NTLM flag indicates support for sealing.
Under SSPI with the NTLM provider, sealing is always performed in combination
with signing (sealing a message simultaneously generates a signature); the
same RC4 keystream is used for both signing and sealing.
<p>
NTLM1 sealing (as done by the SSPI <tt>EncryptMessage</tt> function) is
performed as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized using the previously negotiated key.  This
is done once (before the first sealing operation), and the keystream is never
reset.
</li>
<li>
The message is encrypted using the RC4 cipher; this produces the sealed
ciphertext.
</li>
<li>
A signature for the message is produced, as described previously, and
placed in the security trailer buffer.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As an example, consider the sealing of the message "<tt>jCIFS</tt>"
("<tt>0x6a43494653</tt>") using the 40-bit key "<tt>0x0102030405e538b0</tt>":
<p>
<ol>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized with our key ("<tt>0x0102030405e538b0</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Our message is passed through the RC4 cipher, yielding the ciphertext
"<tt>0x86fc55abca</tt>".  This is the sealed message.
</li>
<li>
The CRC32 checksum of our message is calculated (in little-endian
hexadecimal, "<tt>0xa0310bb7</tt>").
</li>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained.  Since this is the first signing, the
sequence number is zero ("<tt>0x00000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Four zero bytes are concatenated with the CRC32 value and sequence number
to obtain a 12-byte value ("<tt>0x00000000a0310bb700000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
This value is RC4-encrypted using the keystream from our cipher; this
yields the ciphertext "<tt>0x452b490efa3e828bcc8affc3</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The first four bytes are overwritten with a counter value; using
"<tt>0x78010900</tt>" gives "<tt>0x78010900fa3e828bcc8affc3</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The version stamp is concatenated with the result to form the final
signature, which is placed in the security trailer buffer:
<p>
<tt>0x0100000078010900fa3e828bcc8affc3</tt>
<p>
A hexadecimal dump of the entire sealed structure would be:
<p>
<tt><b>0x86fc55abca0100000078010900fa3e828bcc8affc3</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="ntlm2SessionSecurity">
<h2>NTLM2 Session Security</h2>
<p>
NTLM2 is a newer signing and sealing scheme, used when the
"Negotiate NTLM2 Key" flag has been established.  Key derivation in this scheme
is driven by the following NTLM flags:
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">

<a name="ntlm2KeyDerivation">
<h3>NTLM2 Key Derivation</h3>
<p>
Key derivation in NTLM2 is a four-step process:
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Master key negotiation</li>
    <li>Key exchange</li>
    <li>Key weakening</li>
    <li>Subkey generation</li>
</ol>

<a name="ntlm2MasterKeyNegotiation">
<h4>Master Key Negotiation</h4>
<p>
The User Session Key is always used as the base master key in NTLM2 signing
and sealing.  When NTLMv2 authentication is used, either the LMv2 or NTLMv2
User Session Key will be employed as the master key.  When NTLMv1
authentication is used with NTLM2 session security, the NTLM2 Session Response
User Session Key is used as the master key.  Note that the User Session Keys
used in NTLM2 are significantly stronger than either their NTLM1 counterparts
or the Lan Manager Session Key, as they incorporate both the server challenge
and client nonce.

<a name="ntlm2KeyExchange">
<h4>Key Exchange</h4>
<p>
Key exchange is performed as previously discussed for NTLM1.  The client
selects a secondary master key, RC4-encrypts it with the base master key,
and sends the ciphertext value to the server in the Type 3 "Session Key"
field.  This is indicated by the presence of the "Negotiate Key Exchange" flag.

<a name="ntlm2KeyWeakening">
<h4>Key Weakening</h4>
<p>
Key weakening in NTLM2 is performed simply by truncating the master key
(or secondary master key, if key exchange is performed) to the
appropriate length; for example, the master key
"<tt>0xf0f0aabb00112233445566778899aabb</tt>" would be weakened to 40 bits as
"<tt>0xf0f0aabb00</tt>", and 56 bits as "<tt>0xf0f0aabb001122</tt>".  Note that
128-bit keys are supported under NTLM2; in this case, the master key is used
directly in the generation of subkeys (with no weakening performed).
<p>
The master key is only weakened under NTLM2 when generating the sealing
subkeys; the full 128-bit master key is always used in the generation of
signing keys.

<a name="ntlm2SubkeyGeneration">
<h4>Subkey Generation</h4>
<p>
Under NTLM2, up to four subkeys are established; the master key is never
actually used to sign or seal messages.  The subkeys are generated as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The 128-bit (unweakened) master key is concatenated with the
null-terminated ASCII constant string:
<p>
<tt>session key to client-to-server signing key magic constant</tt>
<p>
In hexadecimal, this constant is:
<pre>0x73657373696f6e206b657920746f2063
  6c69656e742d746f2d73657276657220
  7369676e696e67206b6579206d616769
  6320636f6e7374616e7400</pre>
<p>
The line breaks in the above are for display purposes only.  The MD5
message-digest algorithm is applied to this, resulting in a 16-byte
value.  This is the Client Signing Key, used by the client to create
signatures for messages.
</li>
<li>
The unweakened master key is concatenated with the null-terminated ASCII
constant string:
<p>
<tt>session key to server-to-client signing key magic constant</tt>
<p>
In hexadecimal, this constant is:
<pre>0x73657373696f6e206b657920746f2073
  65727665722d746f2d636c69656e7420
  7369676e696e67206b6579206d616769
  6320636f6e7374616e7400</pre>
<p>
The MD5 digest of this is taken, resulting in the 16-byte Server Signing Key.
This is used by the server to create signatures for messages.
</li>
<li>
The weakened (depending on whether 40-bit, 56-bit, or 128-bit encryption
is negotiated) master key is concatenated with the null-terminated ASCII
constant string:
<p>
<tt>session key to client-to-server sealing key magic constant</tt>
<p>
In hexadecimal, this constant is:
<pre>0x73657373696f6e206b657920746f2063
  6c69656e742d746f2d73657276657220

  6320636f6e7374616e7400</pre>
<p>
The MD5 digest is taken to obtain the 16-byte Client Sealing Key.  This is
used by the client to encrypt messages.
</li>
<li>
The weakened master key is concatenated with the null-terminated ASCII
constant string:
<p>
<tt>session key to server-to-client sealing key magic constant</tt>
<p>
In hexadecimal, this constant is:
<pre>0x73657373696f6e206b657920746f2073
  65727665722d746f2d636c69656e7420

  6320636f6e7374616e7400</pre>
<p>
The MD5 digest algorithm is applied, yielding the 16-byte Server Sealing Key.
This key is used by the server to encrypt messages.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="ntlm2Signing">
<h3>Signing</h3>
<p>
Signing support is again indicated by the "Negotiate Sign" NTLM flag.  Signing
by the client is done using the Client Signing Key; the server signs messages
using the Server Signing Key.  Signing keys are generated from the unweakened
master key (as discussed previously).
<p>
NTLM2 signing (as done by the SSPI <tt>MakeSignature</tt> function) is
performed as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained; this starts at zero and is incremented after
each message is signed.  The number is represented as a long (32-bit
little-endian value).
</li>
<li>
The sequence number is concatenated with the message; the HMAC-MD5 message
authentication code algorithm is applied to this value, using the appropriate
Signing Key.  This yields a 16-byte value.
</li>
<li>
If Key Exchange has been negotiated, an RC4 cipher is initialized using the
appropriate <i>Sealing</i> key.  This is done once (during the first operation),
and the keystream is never reset.  The first eight bytes from the HMAC result
are encrypted using this RC4 cipher.  If Key Exchange has <i>not</i> been
negotiated, this sealing operation is omitted.
</li>
<li>
A version number ("<tt>0x01000000</tt>") is concatenated with the result from
the previous step and the sequence number to form the signature.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As an example, assume that we are signing the message "<tt>jCIFS</tt>"
(hexadecimal "<tt>0x6a43494653</tt>") on the client, using the master key
"<tt>0x0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f00</tt>".  This is concatenated with the
client-to-server signing constant, and MD5 is applied to yield the Client
Signing Key ("<tt>0xf7f97a82ec390f9c903dac4f6aceb132</tt>") and Client Sealing
Key ("<tt>0x2785f595293f3e2813439d73a223810d</tt>"); these are used as
follows to sign the message:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained.  Since this is the first message we have
signed, the sequence number is zero ("<tt>0x00000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
The sequence number is concatenated with the message:
<p>
<tt>0x000000006a43494653</tt>
<p>
HMAC-MD5 is applied using the Client Signing Key
("<tt>0xf7f97a82ec390f9c903dac4f6aceb132</tt>").  This results in the 16-byte
value "<tt>0x0a003602317a759a720dc9c7a2a95257</tt>".
</li>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized with our sealing key
("<tt>0x2785f595293f3e2813439d73a223810d</tt>").  The first eight bytes of

</li>
</ol>

<a name="ntlm2Sealing">
<h3>Sealing</h3>
<p>
The "Negotiate Seal" NTLM flag again indicates support for message
confidentiality in NTLM2.  NTLM2 sealing (as done by the SSPI
<tt>EncryptMessage</tt> function) is performed as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized using the appropriate sealing key (depending
on whether the client or server is performing sealing).  This is done once
(before the first sealing operation), and the keystream is never reset.
</li>
<li>
The message is encrypted using the RC4 cipher; this produces the sealed
ciphertext.
</li>
<li>
A signature for the message is produced, as described previously, and
placed in the security trailer buffer.  Note that the RC4 cipher used in the
signing operation has already been initialized (in the previous steps); it
is not reset for the signing operation.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As an example, assume that we are sealing the message "<tt>jCIFS</tt>"
(hexadecimal "<tt>0x6a43494653</tt>") on the client, using the master key
"<tt>0x0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f00</tt>".  As in our previous example, we
generate the Client Signing Key ("<tt>0xf7f97a82ec390f9c903dac4f6aceb132</tt>")
using the unweakened master key.  We also need to generate the Client Sealing
Key; we will assume that 40-bit weakening has been negotiated.  We concatenate
the weakened master key ("<tt>0x0102030405</tt>") with the client-to-server
sealing constant, and MD5 is applied to yield the Client Sealing Key
("<tt>0x6f0d99535033951cbe499cd1914fe9ee</tt>").  The following procedure is
used to seal the message:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
An RC4 cipher is initialized with our Client Sealing Key
("<tt>0x6f0d99535033951cbe499cd1914fe9ee</tt>").
</li>
<li>
Our message is passed through the RC4 cipher, yielding the ciphertext
"<tt>0xcf0eb0a939</tt>".  This is the sealed message.
</li>
<li>
A sequence number is obtained.  Since this is the first signing, the
sequence number is zero ("<tt>0x00000000</tt>").
</li>
<li>
The sequence number is concatenated with the message:
<p>
<tt>0x000000006a43494653</tt>
<p>
HMAC-MD5 is applied using the Client Signing Key
("<tt>0xf7f97a82ec390f9c903dac4f6aceb132</tt>").  This results in the 16-byte
value "<tt>0x0a003602317a759a720dc9c7a2a95257</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The first eight bytes of this value are passed through the sealing cipher,
resulting in the ciphertext "<tt>0x884b14809e53bfe7</tt>".
</li>
<li>
The version stamp is concatenated with the result and the sequence number to
form the final signature, which is placed in the security trailer buffer:
<p>
<tt>0x01000000884b14809e53bfe700000000</tt>
<p>
A hexadecimal dump of the entire sealed structure would be:
<p>
<tt><b>0xcf0eb0a93901000000884b14809e53bfe700000000</b></tt>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="miscellaneousSessionSecurityTopics">
<h2>Miscellaneous Session Security Topics</h2>
<p>
There are a couple of other session security topics which don't really fit
anywhere else:
<ul>
    <li>Datagram Signing &amp; Sealing</li>
    <li>"Dummy" Signing</li>
</ul>

<a name="datagramSigningAndSealing">
<h3>Datagram Signing &amp; Sealing</h3>
<p>
This is used when a datagram context has been established (indicated by
the datagram authentication handshake and the presence of the
"Negotiate Datagram Style" flag).  The semantics regarding datagram session
security are a bit different; signing can begin on the client immediately after
the first call to the SSPI <tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> function (i.e.,
before any communication to the server).  This implies a prearranged signing
and sealing scheme (as signatures can be created before any options are
negotiated with the server).  Datagram session security is based on 40-bit
Lan Manager Session Key NTLM1 with key exchange (although there may be
some means of predetermining a stronger scheme through the registry).
<p>
The sequence number is not incremented in datagram mode; it is fixed at zero,
and each signature reflects this.  Also, the RC4 keystream is reset for each
signing or sealing operation.  This is significant, in that messages are
potentially susceptible to known plaintext attacks.

<a name="dummySigning">
<h3>"Dummy" Signing</h3>
<p>
This is used if the SSPI context was initialized without specifying support
for message integrity.  If the "Negotiate Always Sign" NTLM flag is
established, calls to <tt>MakeSignature</tt> will succeed, returning the
constant "signature":
<p>
<tt>0x01000000000000000000000000000000</tt>
<p>
Calls to <tt>EncryptMessage</tt> succeed normally (including the "real"
signature in the security trailer buffer).  If "Negotiate Always Sign" is not
negotiated, both signing and sealing will fail.

<h2>Appendix B:  Application Protocol Usage of NTLM</h2>
This section examines the use of NTLM authentication within some of
Microsoft's network protocol implementations.

<a name="ntlmHttpAuthentication">
<h3>NTLM HTTP Authentication</h3>
<p>
Microsoft has established the proprietary "NTLM" authentication scheme for HTTP
to provide integrated authentication to IIS web servers.  This authentication
mechanism allows clients to access resources using their Windows credentials,
and is typically used within corporate environments to provide single sign-on
functionality to intranet sites.  Historically, NTLM authentication was only
supported by Internet Explorer; recently, however, support has been added
to various other user agents.
<p>
The NTLM HTTP authentication mechanism works as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The client requests a protected resource from the server:
<pre>
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with a 401 status, indicating that the client must
authenticate.  "NTLM" is presented as a supported authentication mechanism
via the "<tt>WWW-Authenticate</tt>" header.  Typically, the server closes
the connection at this time:
<pre>
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    WWW-Authenticate: NTLM
    Connection: close
</pre>
<p>
Note that Internet Explorer will only select NTLM if it is the first
mechanism offered; this is at odds with RFC 2616, which states that the
client must select the strongest supported authentication scheme.
</li>
<li>
The client resubmits the request with an "<tt>Authorization</tt>" header
containing a Type 1 message parameter.  The Type 1 message is Base-64 encoded
for transmission.  From this point forward, the connection is kept open;
closing the connection requires reauthentication of subsequent requests.
This implies that the server and client must support persistent connections,
via either the HTTP 1.0-style "Keep-Alive" header or HTTP 1.1 (in which
persistent connections are employed by default).  The relevant request headers
appear as follows (the line break in the "<tt>Authorization</tt>" header below
is for display purposes only, and is not present in the actual message):
<pre>
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAABzIAAAYABgArAAAACwALACAAAABXT1
    JLU1RBVElPTkRPTUFJTg==
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server replies with a 401 status containing a Type 2 message in the
"<tt>WWW-Authenticate</tt>" header (again, Base-64 encoded).  This is
shown below (the line breaks in the "<tt>WWW-Authenticate</tt>" header are
for editorial clarity only, and are not present in the actual header).
<pre>
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    WWW-Authenticate: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAACAAAADAAMADAAAAABAoEAASNFZ4mrze8
    AAAAAAAAAAGIAYgA8AAAARABPAE0AQQBJAE4AAgAMAEQATwBNAEEASQBOAAEADABTA

    ALgBkAG8AbQBhAGkAbgAuAGMAbwBtAAAAAAA=
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The client responds to the Type 2 message by resubmitting the request with
an "<tt>Authorization</tt>" header containing a Base-64 encoded Type 3 message
(again, the line breaks in the "<tt>Authorization</tt>" header below are for
display purposes only):
<pre>
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAADAAAAGAAYAGoAAAAYABgAggAAAAwADABAAA
    AACAAIAEwAAAAWABYAVAAAAAAAAACaAAAAAQIAAEQATwBNAEEASQBOAHUAcwBlAHIA
    VwBPAFIASwBTAFQAQQBUAEkATwBOAMM3zVy9RPyXgqZnr21CfG3mfCDC0+d8ViWpjB
    wx6BhHRmspst9GgPOZWPuMITqcxg==
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Finally, the server validates the responses in the client's Type 3 message and
allows access to the resource.
<pre>
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This scheme differs from most "normal" HTTP authentication mechanisms, in that
subsequent requests over the authenticated connection are not themselves
authenticated; NTLM is connection-oriented, rather than request-oriented.  So
a second request for "<tt>/index.html</tt>" would not carry any authentication
information, and the server would request none.  If the server detects that
the connection to the client has been dropped, a request for
"<tt>/index.html</tt>" would result in the server reinitiating the NTLM
handshake.
<p>
A notable exception to the above is the client's behavior when submitting
a POST request (typically employed when the client is sending form data to the
server).  If the client determines that the server is not the local host,
the <i>client</i> will initiate reauthentication for POST requests over the
active connection.  The client will first submit an empty POST request
with a Type 1 message in the "<tt>Authorization</tt>" header; the server
responds with the Type 2 message (in the "<tt>WWW-Authenticate</tt>" header
as shown above).  The client then resubmits the POST with the Type 3 message,
sending the form data with the request.
<p>
The NTLM HTTP mechanism can also be used for HTTP proxy authentication.  The
process is similar, except:
<ul>
<li>
The server uses the 407 response code (indicating proxy authentication
required) rather than 401.
</li>
<li>
The client's Type 1 and 3 messages are sent in the
"<tt>Proxy-Authorization</tt>" request header, rather than the
"<tt>Authorization</tt>" header.
</li>
<li>
The server's Type 2 challenge is sent in the "<tt>Proxy-Authenticate</tt>"
response header (instead of "<tt>WWW-Authenticate</tt>").
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the "Negotiate" HTTP authentication
mechanism.  While primarily aimed at providing a means of authenticating the
user against Active Directory via Kerberos, it is backward-compatible with
the NTLM scheme.  When the Negotiate mechanism is used in "legacy" mode,
the headers passed between the client and server are identical, except
"Negotiate" (rather than "NTLM") is indicated as the mechanism name.

<a name="ntlmPop3Authentication">
<h3>NTLM POP3 Authentication</h3>
<p>
Microsoft's Exchange server provides an NTLM authentication mechanism for the
POP3 protocol.  This is a proprietary extension used with the POP3
<tt>AUTH</tt> command as documented in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1734.txt">RFC 1734</a>.  On the client
side, this mechanism is supported by Outlook and Outlook Express, and is called
"Secure Password Authentication".
<p>
The POP3 NTLM authentication handshake occurs during the POP3 "authorization"
state, and works as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The client may request a list of supported authentication mechanisms by
sending the <tt>AUTH</tt> command with no arguments:
<pre>
    AUTH
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with a success message, followed by the list of supported
mechanisms; this list should include "<tt>NTLM</tt>", and is terminated by a
line containing a single period ("<tt>.</tt>").
<pre>
    +OK The operation completed successfully.
    NTLM
    .
</pre>
<li>
The client initiates NTLM authentication by sending an <tt>AUTH</tt> command
specifying NTLM as the authentication mechanism:
<pre>
    AUTH NTLM
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with a success message as shown below.  Note that there
is a space between the "<tt>+</tt>" and the "<tt>OK</tt>"; RFC 1734 states
that the server should reply with a challenge, but NTLM requires the Type 1
message from the client.  So the server sends a "non-challenge", which is
basically the message "<tt>OK</tt>".
<pre>
    + OK
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The client then sends the Type 1 message, Base-64 encoded for transmission:
<pre>
    TlRMTVNTUAABAAAABzIAAAYABgArAAAACwALACAAAABXT1JLU1RBVElPTkRPTUFJTg==
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server replies with the Type 2 challenge message (again, Base-64 encoded).
This is send in the challenge format specified by RFC 1734 ("<tt>+</tt>",
followed by a space, followed by the challenge message).  This is shown
below; the line breaks are for editorial clarity and are not present in the
server's reply:

    AGMAbwBtAAAAAAA=

<li>
The client calculates and sends the Base-64 encoded Type 3 response (the
line breaks below are for display purposes only):

</li>
<li>
The server validates the response and indicates the result of authentication:
<pre>
    +OK User successfully logged on
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
After successful authentication has occurred, the POP3 session enters the
"transaction" state, allowing messages to be retrieved by the client.

<a name="ntlmImapAuthentication">
<h3>NTLM IMAP Authentication</h3>
<p>
Exchange provides an IMAP authentication mechanism similar in form to the
POP3 mechanism previously discussed.  IMAP authentication is documented in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1730.txt">RFC 1730</a>; the NTLM
mechanism is a proprietary extension provided by Exchange and supported
by the Outlook client family.
<p>
The handshake sequence is similar to the POP3 mechanism:
<ol>
<li>
The server may indicate support for the NTLM authentication mechanism in the
capability response.  Upon connecting to the IMAP server, the client would
request the list of server capabilities:
<pre>
    0000 CAPABILITY
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with the list of supported capabilities; the NTLM
authentication extension is indicated by the presence of the string
"<tt>AUTH=NTLM</tt>" in the server's reply:
<pre>
    * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 IDLE LITERAL+ AUTH=NTLM
    0000 OK CAPABILITY completed.
</pre>
<li>
The client initiates NTLM authentication by sending an <tt>AUTHENTICATE</tt>
command specifying NTLM as the authentication mechanism:
<pre>
    0001 AUTHENTICATE NTLM
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with an empty challenge, consisting simply of a
"<tt>+</tt>":
<pre>
    +
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The client then sends the Type 1 message, Base-64 encoded for transmission:
<pre>
    TlRMTVNTUAABAAAABzIAAAYABgArAAAACwALACAAAABXT1JLU1RBVElPTkRPTUFJTg==
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server replies with the Type 2 challenge message (again, Base-64 encoded).
This is send in the challenge format specified by RFC 1730 ("<tt>+</tt>",
followed by a space, followed by the challenge message).  This is shown
below; the line breaks are for editorial clarity and are not present in the

The server validates the response and indicates the result of authentication:

After authentication has completed, the IMAP session enters the
authenticated state.

<a name="ntlmSmtpAuthentication">
<h3>NTLM SMTP Authentication</h3>
<p>
In addition to the NTLM authentication mechanisms provided for POP3 and IMAP,
Exchange provides similar functionality for the SMTP protocol.  This allows
NTLM authentication of users sending outgoing mail messages.  This is a
proprietary extension used with the SMTP <tt>AUTH</tt> command (documented in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2554.txt">RFC 2554</a>).
<p>
The SMTP NTLM authentication handshake operates as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The server may indicate support for NTLM as an authentication mechanism
in the <tt>EHLO</tt> reply.  Upon connecting to the SMTP server, the client
would send the initial <tt>EHLO</tt> message:
<pre>
    EHLO client.example.com
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server responds with the list of supported extensions; the NTLM
authentication extension is indicated by its presence in the list
of <tt>AUTH</tt> mechanisms as shown below.  Note that the <tt>AUTH</tt>
list is sent twice (once with an "<tt>=</tt>" and once without).  The
"<tt>AUTH=</tt>" form was apparently specified in a draft of the RFC;
sending both forms ensures that clients implemented against this draft are
supported.
<pre>
    250-server.example.com Hello [10.10.2.20]
    250-HELP
    250-AUTH LOGIN NTLM
    250-AUTH=LOGIN NTLM
    250 SIZE 10240000
</pre>
<li>
The client initiates NTLM authentication by sending an <tt>AUTH</tt>
command specifying NTLM as the authentication mechanism and providing the
Base-64 encoded Type 1 message as a parameter:
<pre>
    AUTH NTLM TlRMTVNTUAABAAAABzIAAAYABgArAAAACwALACAAAABXT1JLU1RBVElPTkRPTUFJTg==
</pre>
<p>
According to RFC 2554, the client may opt not to send the initial response
parameter (instead merely sending "<tt>AUTH NTLM</tt>" and waiting for an
empty server challenge before replying with the Type 1 message).  However,
this did not appear to work properly when tested against Exchange.
</li>
<li>
The server replies with a 334 response containing the Type 2 challenge
message (again, Base-64 encoded).  This is shown below; the line breaks are
for editorial clarity and are not present in the server's reply:
<pre>
    334 TlRMTVNTUAACAAAADAAMADAAAAABAoEAASNFZ4mrze8AAAAAAAAAAGIAYgA8AAAA
    RABPAE0AQQBJAE4AAgAMAEQATwBNAEEASQBOAAEADABTAEUAUgBWAEUAUgAEABQAZA
    BvAG0AYQBpAG4ALgBjAG8AbQADACIAcwBlAHIAdgBlAHIALgBkAG8AbQBhAGkAbgAu
    AGMAbwBtAAAAAAA=
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The client calculates and sends the Base-64 encoded Type 3 response (the
line breaks below are for display purposes only):
<pre>
    TlRMTVNTUAADAAAAGAAYAGoAAAAYABgAggAAAAwADABAAAAACAAIAEwAAAAWABYAVA
    AAAAAAAACaAAAAAQIAAEQATwBNAEEASQBOAHUAcwBlAHIAVwBPAFIASwBTAFQAQQBU
    AEkATwBOAMM3zVy9RPyXgqZnr21CfG3mfCDC0+d8ViWpjBwx6BhHRmspst9GgPOZWP
    uMITqcxg==
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The server validates the response and indicates the result of authentication:
<pre>
    235 NTLM authentication successful.
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
After authenticating, the client is able to send messages normally.

<h2>Appendix C:  Sample NTLMSSP Operation Decompositions</h2>
<p>
This section contains detailed analysis and decomposition of various
authentication and signing/sealing operations.  This is by no means a
comprehensive catalog of possible scenarios, but does include some of the
more interesting variants.  These were produced by calling the
<tt>InitializeSecurityContext</tt> and <tt>AcceptSecurityContext</tt> SSPI
functions between two peers, and applying subtle manipulations to the resulting
NTLM messages.  After the context was established, the
<tt>ExportSecurityContext</tt> function was called to dump the contents of the
context to a file, for use in subsequent offline analysis.  Additionally,
the <tt>MakeSignature</tt> and <tt>EncryptMessage</tt> functions were used to
perform signing and sealing, respectively.
