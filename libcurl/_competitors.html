<p>
Free Software and Open Source projects have a long tradition of forks and
duplicate efforts. We enjoy "doing it ourselves", no matter if someone else
has done something very similar already.

<p>
 Alternative libraries that cover parts of libcurl's features:

<p>
<b><a href="./">libcurl</a></b> (MIT)<br>
<ul>
  a highly portable and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library,
  supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,
  LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.
  libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP
  uploading, kerberos, HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password
  authentication, file transfer resume, http proxy tunnelling and more!
</ul>

<p>
<b>libghttp</b> (LGPL)<br>
<ul>
  Having a glance at libghttp (a gnome http library), it looks as if it works
  rather similar to libcurl (for http). There's no web page for this and the
  person who's email is mentioned in the README of the latest release I found
  claims he has passed the leadership of the project to "eazel". Popular
  choice among GNOME projects.
</ul>
<b><a href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a></b> (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C license</a>) <a href="libwww.html">comparison with libcurl</a> <br>
<ul>
  More complex, and and harder to use than libcurl is. Includes everything
  from multi-threading to HTML parsing. The most notable transfer-related
  feature that libcurl does not offer but libwww does, is caching.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.westga.edu/~stu7440/projects/ferit.html">libferit</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  C++ library "for transferring files via http, ftp, gopher, proxy server".
  Based on 'snarf' 2.0.9-code (formerly known as libsnarf).  Quote from
  freshmeat: <i>"As the author of snarf, I have to say this frightens
  me. Snarf's networking system is far from robust and complete. It's probably
  full of bugs, and although it works for maybe 85% of all current situations,
  I wouldn't base a library on it."</i>

</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">neon</a></b> (LGPL) <a href="neon.html">comparison with neon</a> <br>
<ul>
  An HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. I've mainly heard
  and seen people use this with WebDAV as their main interest. This is one
  of the two alternatives used by the Subversion project.
</ul>

<b><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libsoup/">libsoup</a></b> (LGPL)  <a href="libsoup.html">comparison with libcurl</a><br>
<ul>

 Asynchronous DNS and transfers, Connection cache, Redirects, Basic, Digest,
 NTLM authentication, SSL with GnuTLS, Proxy support including SSL, SOCKS
 support, POST data. Not portable. Lacks: cookie support, NTLM for proxies,
 GSS, gzip encoding, trailers in chunked responses, portability and more.

</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/">mozilla netlib</a></b> (MPL)<br>
<ul>

</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpnet/">mozilla libxpnet</a></b> (MPL)<br>

  mentioned netlib. HTTP and FTP support.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://wget.sunsite.dk/">wget</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
  While not a library at all, I've been told that people sometimes extract the
  network code from it and base their own hacks from there.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libfetch/">libfetch</a></b> (BSD)<br>
<ul>
 Does HTTP and FTP transfers (both ways), supports file: URLs, and an API for
 URL parsing. The utility <i>fetch</i> that is built on libfetch is an
 integral part of the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> operating
 system.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://http-fetcher.sourceforge.net/">HTTP Fetcher</a></b>

<ul>
  <i>"The Windows Internet (WinINet) application programming interface (API)

 servers. A client computer can use the XMLHTTP object to send an arbitrary
 HTTP request, receive the response, and have the Microsoft® XML Document
 Object Model (DOM) parse that response.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.0/qhttp.html">QHttp</a></b> (GPL)<br>
<ul>
 QHttp is a class in the Qt library from Troll Tech. Seems to be restricted
 to plain HTTP. Supports GET, POST and proxy. Asynchronous.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/ftplib/">ftplib</a></b> (GPL)
<ul>
 "<i>a set of routines that implement the FTP protocol. They allow
 applications to create and access remote files through function calls instead
 of needing to fork and exec an interactive ftp client program."</i>

  component. It uses glib, and integrates very well within Gtk+ applications,
  which require event-driven programming.
</ul>

<b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/serf/">Serf</a></b> (Apache License)

 Have <b>you</b> tried programming with one of the other libs and care share
your experiences? We'd love to make this collection more complete and feature
lengthier comments about each lib.
