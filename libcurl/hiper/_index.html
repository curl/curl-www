TITLE(High Performance libcurl)
<p>
  Hiper is the name of the sub-project that intends to bring high performance
  adjustments and additions to the libcurl multi interface.
<p>
  The aim is to
<ol>

<li> provide a better API for <i>extremely</i> large amounts of simultaneous
  transfers (the <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">c10k problem</a>).
  By better API, we mean both better suited to deal with the amount of
  connections (i.e no artificial limits like select() imposes etc), better
  performance-wise by avoiding expensive looping over all file descriptors to
  check for actions and to allow users to pick an underlying event system of
  their own choice.

<li> add <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/http/pipelining-faq.html">HTTP
pipelining</a> support.

<li> (NEW) provide a <i>zero copy</i> interface that reduces the amount of
 data copies needed when transferring data to/from memory.

</ol>
<p>
  The order above is the order of preference and implementation.
<p>
  I've also decided <i>not to</i>:
<ol>

<li> Make any parts of this new API aware of any thread API or similar, it
remains thread agnostic but of course perfectly good to use in (many) threads.

<li> Offer any API to help applications to dispatch transfer jobs between many
threads. A high-volume transfer application could very well have N threads
with a multi handle in each, using the <i>Hiper</i> API, but we do not offer
any built-in support to dispatch transfers to the various threads. This is
indeed room for future improvements.

</ol>
<p>
SUBTITLE(Schedule)
<p>
  Daniel intends to work more or less full-time with the Hiper project during
  December 2005. Leftovers will be done part-time in 2006 with possibly some
  further full-time periods during spring 2006.
<p>
  I'll get back with more <a href="schedule.html">specific (release) dates</a>
  later on. See also the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>.

SUBTITLE(Funding)
<p>
  Daniel receives <a
  href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-10/0136.html">funding</a> from the
  Swedish foundation IIS for the purpose of implementing this.

SUBTITLE(Project Involvement)
<p>
  The plan is to keep the process and progress as open and public as I
  possibly can, to allow anyone and everyone who feels like contributing or
  just watching to do so. This is still curl, this is still open source and I
  still value and appreciate all user feedback and comments.
<p>
  Progress reports will be posted and discussions will be held on the regular
  <a
  href="http://curl.haxx.se/mail/list.cgi?list=curl-library">curl-library</a>
  mailing list. I will also post "quarterly" reports in Swedish to IIS (as
  mandated by the contract I've signed with them as a condition for me to
  receive the money), and I will make those reports available here online as
  well.

SUBTITLE(Source Code Repository)
<p>
  For the sake of being able to be 100% public and open, I will create a
  branch in the CVS repository so that the Hiper experiments and developments
  won't interfere with the "normal" libcurl development.
<p>
  The name of the tag will be announced when this has been done.
