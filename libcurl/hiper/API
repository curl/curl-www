/*
 * Name:    curl_multi_socket() and
 *          curl_multi_socket_all()
 *
 * Desc:    An alternative version of curl_multi_perform() that allows the
 *          application to pass in one of the file descriptors that have been
 *          detected to have "action" on them and let libcurl perform. This
 *          allows libcurl to not have to scan through all possible file
 *          descriptors to check for this. The app is recommended to pass in
 *          the 'easy' argument (or set it to CURL_EASY_NONE) to make libcurl
 *          figure out the internal structure even faster and easier.  If the
 *          easy argument is set to something else than CURL_EASY_NONE, the
 *          's' (socket) argument will be ignored by libcurl.
 *
 *          It also informs the application about updates in the socket (file
 *          descriptor) status by doing none, one or multiple calls to the
 *          curl_socket_callback. It thus updates the status with changes
 *          since the previous time this function was used. If 'callback' is
 *          NULL, no callback will be called. A status change may also be a
 *          new timeout only, having the same IN/OUT status as before.
 *
 *          If a previous wait for socket action(s) timed out, you should call
 *          this function with the socket argument set to
 *          CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT. If you want to force libcurl to (re-)check
 *          all its internal sockets, and call the callback with status for
 *          all sockets no matter what the previous state is, you call
 *          curl_multi_socket_all() instead.
 *
 *          curl_multi_perform() is thus the equivalent of calling
 *          curl_multi_socket_all(handle, NULL, NULL);
 *
 *          IMPLEMENTATION: libcurl will need an internal hash table to map
 *          socket numbers to internal easy handles for the cases when 'easy'
 *          is set to CURL_EASY_NONE.
 *
 *          Regarding the timeout argument in the callback: it is the timeout
 *          (in milliseconds) for waiting on action on this socket (and the
 *          given time period starts when the callback is called) until you
 *          should call curl_multi_socket() with the timeout stuff mentioned
 *          above. If "actions" happens on the socket before the timeout
 *          happens, remember that the timeout timer keeps ticking until told
 *          otherwise.
 *
 *          The "what" argument has one of five values:
 *
 *            0 CURL_POLL_NONE (0)   - register, not interested in readiness
 *            1 CURL_POLL_IN         - register, interested in read readiness
 *            2 CURL_POLL_OUT        - register, interested in write readiness
 *            3 CURL_POLL_INOUT      - register, interested in both
 *            4 CURL_POLL_REMOVE     - deregister
