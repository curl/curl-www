TITLE(Easy or Multi)
<p>
 The easy interface is a synchronous, efficient, quickly used and... yes, easy
 interface for Internet transfers. Numerous applications have been built using
 this.
<p>
 The multi interface is the asynchronous brother in the family and it also
 offers multiple transfers using a single thread and more. Get a grip of how
 to work with it in <a href="libcurl-multi.html">the multi interface
 overview</a>.

 1. <a href="curl_easy_init.html">init</a> your easy-session and get a handle,
 which you use as input to the following interface functions you use.
<p>
 2. Set all the <a href="curl_easy_setopt.html">options</a> you want in the
 upcoming transfer, most important among them is the URL itself. You might
 want to set some callbacks as well that are called from the library when
 data is available etc.
<p>
 3. When all is setup, tell libcurl
 to <a href="curl_easy_perform.html">perform</a> the transfer. It then does
 the entire operation and does not return until it is done or failed.
<p>
 4. After the transfer is completed, you may <a href="curl_easy_getinfo.html">get
 information</a> about it and then you

 5. <a href="curl_easy_cleanup.html">cleanup</a> the easy-session's handle and
 libcurl is entirely off the hook!
