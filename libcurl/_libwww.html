 These are only some quick notes. If you have additional experiencies and
comments you want to share with the world, we're all ears!

<ul>

 <li> libcurl is (far) more portable

 <li> libcurl is supported and has a living community (compare traffic on the
 mailing lists, release frequency or similar)

 <li> programs need less code to transfer files using libcurl than a libwww-
 based equivalent

 <li> libcurl is thread-safe, libwww is not

 <li> libcurl has a different feature-set and offers several features not
 present in libwww, like several HTTP authentication types and gzip support

 <li> libcurl supports more protocols

 <li> libwww offers HTTP pipelining, which libcurl doesn't

</ul>

Having used both, I'd recommend libcurl and definitely not libwww.
<p>
libcurl is easy to use and gives good performance.  libwww is a nightmare to 
use, performs poorly (no overlapped I/O support, for example), and is 
practically undocumented (on top of which it's a very complex library). 
libwww is really a platform for network protocol development, not a library 
for basic access to well known network protocol stacks.

I devoted a full man-month trying to understand libwww, writing a function of
intermediate complexity (supporting post requests, xml parsing, authentication
etc.)  and figuring out that the problems I encountered were due to libwww and
not my code.
<p>
I switched to libcurl, rewrote the same code in a week and haven't
looked back. 
<p>
Perhaps this library has some features that libcurl doesn't, though I didn't
have to use them for my needs.  However, for libwww to survive, someone has to
focus on these features and let libcurl do the rest.
<p>
Personally, I can't find any reason to suggest libwww to anyone.
