<p>
 These are some notes about libcurl compared against <a
href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">neon</a>. If you have additional
experiencies and comments you want to share with the world, we're all ears!

<ul>

 <li> libcurl is more portable (VMS, OS/400, etc)

 <li> neon lacks support for: NTLM on non-windows, it doesn't offer SSL
  built to use NSS, it doesn't support cookies, it doesn't support compression
  deflating and it only supports HTTP(S) as transfer protocol

 <li> neon offers WebDAV support

</ul>

<i>"I found that libneon is actually a bit more efficient (maybe 33% fewer CPU
cycles in a similar setup as above), but I think only because it does blocking
reads.  libneon is also a lot more work to use, as it forces the user to
implement more of the HTTP session state machine."</i> - Matt Gruenke
