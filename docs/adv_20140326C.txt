        libcurl not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl
        =============================================================

Project cURL Security Advisory, March 26th 2014
https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html

1. VULNERABILITY

  When asked to do a TLS connection (HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, etc) to a URL
  specified with an IP address instead of a name, libcurl would wrongly not
  verify the server's name in the certificate. The signature (whether it was
  signed by a trusted CA) and validity (whether the date was within the
  certificate's lifetime and it was not revoked) verifications were still
  performed.

  This is a problem in libcurl built to use the SecureTransport/Darwinssl
  backend. SecureTransport/Darwinssl is the TLS library present and used on
  Mac OS X and iOS.

  Only users on Mac OS X or iOS can be affected by this. And only if libcurl
  was built to use the native TLS backend library.

  This problem was initially used as an example of the Apple SSL bug that hit
  the news in late February 2014[1] but that was not correct.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2014-1263 to this issue.

2. AFFECTED VERSIONS

  This flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support the
  SecureTransport/Darwinssl backend.

  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.27.0 to and including 7.35.0
  Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.36.0

  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

3. THE SOLUTION

  libcurl 7.36.0 makes sure that all TLS using requests verify the host name
  even if specified as an IP address in the URL.

  A patch for this problem is available at:

    https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/afc6e5004fabee

  The fix was committed to the public source code repository because the full
  security impact wasn't properly realized until after the fact.

4. RECOMMENDATIONS

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.36.0

  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

  C - Rebuild libcurl to use another TLS backend

5. TIME LINE

  It was discovered by the curl project during late February 2014.

  libcurl 7.36.0 was released on March 26th 2014, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.

6. CREDITS

  This was indirectly reported by numerous people and it was also clarified by
  Adam Langley that it wasn't the problem Apple themselves fixed. Roland Moriz
  is credited in Apple's security note[2].

  David Ryskalczyk wrote the patch.

  Nick Zitzmann helped coordinate the bug fix.

  Apple claims to have fixed this problem in an update of their own. That was
  done independently from and without informing the curl project.
