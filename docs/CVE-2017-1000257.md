IMAP FETCH response out of bounds read
======================================

Project curl Security Advisory, October 23rd 2017 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2017-1000257.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a buffer overrun flaw in the IMAP handler.

An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number
of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass
on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the
deliver-data function.

libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes
strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a
heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read
beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then
deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.

INFO
----

This bug was introduced when the initial support for IMAP was introduced.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2017-1000257 to this issue.

CWE-126: Buffer Over-read

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.20.0 to and including 7.56.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.20.0 and >= 7.56.1
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ec3bb8f727

curl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.

SOLUTION
------------

In libcurl version 7.56.1, a zero bytes response is not passed on.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/13c9a9ded3ae744a1e11cbc14e9146d9fa427040

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.56.1

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

 C - Switch off IMAP in `CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS`

TIMELINE
---------

It was reported to the curl project on October 6, 2017. We contacted
distros@openwall on October 17.

curl 7.56.1 was released on October 23 2017, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.
