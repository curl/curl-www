Authentication Buffer Overflows
===============================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 21st 2005 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2005-0490.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

Due to bad usage of the base64 decode function to a stack-based buffer without
checking the data length, it was possible for a malicious HTTP server to
overflow the client during NTLM negotiation and for an FTP server to overflow
the client during krb4 negotiation. The
[announcement](http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=202) of this
flaw was done without contacting us.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2005-0490 to this issue.

CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow

(This flaw was originally treated as two separate ones by the curl project,
but due to it using a single CVE number we've reconsidered.)

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.3 to and including curl 7.13.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.3 and curl >= 7.13.1
