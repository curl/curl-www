                         libcurl cookie leak for TLDs
                         ============================

Project curl Security Advisory, September 10th 2014
https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html

1. VULNERABILITY

  libcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs), thus
  making them apply broader than cookies are allowed. This can allow arbitrary
  sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a different and unrelated
  site or domain.

2. INFO

  Cookie parsing and use is opt-in by applications and is not enabled by
  default.

  libcurl's cookie parser has no Public Suffix awareness, so apart from
  rejecting TLDs from being allowed it might still allow cookies for domains
  that are otherwise widely rejected by ordinary browsers. See
  https://publicsuffix.org/ for details.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2014-3620 to this issue.

  CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

3. AFFECTED VERSIONS

  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.31.0 to and including 7.37.1
  Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.31.0 and libcurl >= 7.38.0

  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

4. THE SOLUTION

  libcurl 7.38.0 doesn't accept cookies set for just a TLD. Note that it does
  not add any public suffix awareness apart from that.

  A patch for this problem is available at:

    https://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2014-3620.patch

5. RECOMMENDATIONS

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.38.0

  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

  C - Avoid using cookies in your application

6. TIME LINE

  It was reported to the curl project on August 15th 2014. We contacted
  distros@openwall on September 1st.

  libcurl 7.38.0 was released on September 10th 2014, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.

7. CREDITS

  Reported by Tim Ruehsen. Patch written by Daniel Stenberg.

  Thanks a lot!
