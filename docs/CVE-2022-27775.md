Bad local IPv6 connection reuse
===============================

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27 2022 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27775.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent
transfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.

Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take the IPv6
address zone id into account which could lead to libcurl reusing the wrong
connection when one transfer uses a zone id and a subsequent transfer uses
another (or no) zone id.

INFO
----

Zone ids are only used for non-global scoped IPv6 addresses and they are only
used when specifying the address numerically.

This flaw has existed in curl since commit
[2d0e9b40d3237b1](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2d0e9b40d3237b1),
shipped in libcurl 7.65.0, released on May 22 2019. Previous versions instead
do not accept URLs with zone ids.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-27775 to this issue.

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

Severity: Low

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.65.0 to and including 7.82.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.65.0 and curl >= 7.83.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2d0e9b40d3237b1

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always advertised
as such.

SOLUTION
------------

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/058f98dc3fe595f21dc26

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.83.0

 B - Apply the patch to your local version

 C - Do not use non-global numerical IPv6 addresses in URLs to curl

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 21, 2022. We contacted
distros@openwall on April 21.

libcurl 7.83.0 was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.
