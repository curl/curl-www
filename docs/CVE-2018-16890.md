NTLM type-2 out-of-bounds buffer read
=====================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 6th 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16890.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap buffer out-of-bounds read flaw.

The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages
(`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data
correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability.

Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to
accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read
out-of-bounds.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
