FTP wildcard stack overflow
===========================

Project curl Security Advisory, December 9th 2020 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8285.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a callback (set
with `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION`) to return information back to libcurl on
how to handle a specific entry in a directory when libcurl iterates over a
list of all available entries.

When this callback returns `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP`, to tell libcurl to not
deal with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls itself
recursively to handle the next directory entry.

If there's a sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns
"skip" enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space. The exact
amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other environmental
factors.

The content of the remote directory is not kept on the stack, so it seems hard
for the attacker to control exactly what data that overwrites the stack -
however it remains a Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious user who controls
a server that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can
trigger a crash.

(There is also a few other ways the function can be made to call itself and
trigger this problem.)

INFO
----

This issue was unfortunately reported publicly in the curl GitHub issue
tracker as [issue 6255](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/6255).

This functionality is not used by the curl tool so it is not affected.
Further: it is not a very widely used feature.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2020-8285 to this issue.

CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.21.0 to and including 7.73.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.21.0 and libcurl >= 7.74.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0825cd80a

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

SOLUTION
------------

The internal function is rewritten to instead and more appropriately use an
ordinary loop instead of the recursive approach. This way, the stack use will
remain the same no matter how many files that are skipped.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/69a358f2186e04

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade libcurl to version 7.74.0

 B - Disable FTP wildcard use (`CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH`)

 C - Make sure your `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback doesn't do multiple skips.

TIMELINE
--------
