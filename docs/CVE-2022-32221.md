POST following PUT confusion
============================

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32221.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback
(`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the
`CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was
used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.

This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either
send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent
`POST` request.

The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a
PUT to a POST.

INFO
----

The code actually sending wrong data or doing a use after free is not present
in libcurl code but are only presumed scenarios that might become the outcome
of libcurl surprisingly calling the read callback in a situation where it is
not expected to.

This flaw cannot be triggered with the command line tool.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-32221 to this issue.

CWE-440: Expected Behavior Violation

Severity: medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.7 to and including 7.85.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.7 and >= 7.86.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/546572da0457f3

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

The fix for CVE-2022-32221 was committed to the curl git repository and made
public before the security impact of this issue become clear to us. The
security impact was not highlighted in the commit message nor surrounding
messaging.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/a64e3e59938abd7d6

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.86.0

 B - Apply the patch to your local version

 C - Do not do mix using the read callback and `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` string on
     a reused easy handle

TIMELINE
