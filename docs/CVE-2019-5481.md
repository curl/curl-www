FTP-KRB double-free
===================

Project curl Security Advisory, September 11th 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-5481.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl can be told to use kerberos over FTP to a server, as set with the
`CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` option.

During such kerberos FTP data transfer, the server sends data to curl in
blocks with the 32 bit size of each block first and then that amount of data
immediately following.

A malicious or just broken server can claim to send a very large block and if
by doing that it makes curl's subsequent call to `realloc()` to fail, curl
would then misbehave in the exit path and double-free the memory.

In practical terms, an up to 4 GB memory area may very well be fine to
allocate on a modern 64 bit system but on 32 bit systems it will fail.

Kerberos FTP is a rarely used protocol with curl. Also, Kerberos
authentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that the client
has a previous association with.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This bug was introduced in November 2016 in [commit
