TITLE(IRC - chat with curl enthusiasts)
<p>
 We have an always-open never-sleeping 24/7 chat room available to discuss any
 and all curl and libcurl related topics whenever you want.

<p> You find us in the <b>#curl</b> channel on the <b>Libera.Chat IRC</b> network.

<p> This is the only official curl chat. You will find that some of the curl
 core team developers frequent this chat.

SUBTITLE(How to join)
<p>
  Libera.Chat offers a <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/clients">comprehensive guide</a>
  regarding various ways on joining the network.

SUBTITLE(How to speak)
<p>
 You will notice that you must "register" your nick name first on the network
 to be allowed to talk in the channel. This is an unfortunate anti-spam and
 anti-abuse measurement.
<p>
 The good part is
 that <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/registration">it is easy to
 register</a>.

SUBTITLE(What if nobody responds)
<p>
  There's no guarantee anyone wants to respond or that anyone who reads right
  now even knows the answer to your question. Consider maybe post your
  questions or thoughts on a <a href="/mail/">suitable mailing list?</a>

SUBTITLE(Screenshot)

  A screenshot example of a discussion in the #curl channel from early April
  2021.  Seen here in action is the Linux IRC
  client <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/">hexchat</a>. The time stamps on
  the left are shown using the local time zone of Daniel ('bagder') Stenberg.
