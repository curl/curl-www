TITLE(Chat with fellow curl enthusiasts)
<p>
 We have an always-open never-sleeping 24/7 chat room available to discuss any
 and all curl and libcurl related topics whenever you want.

<p> This is the only official curl chat. You will find that some of the curl
 core team developers frequent this chat.

SUBTITLE(Participate)
<ul>

<li> IRC: Join the channel <b>#curl</b> on the network <b>Libera.Chat</b>.
  Check out the <a href="https://libera.chat/guides/clients">comprehensive
  guide</a> how to use the network.

<li> Matrix: alternatively, you join the Matrix
  channel <b><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#curl:curl.se">#curl:curl.se</a></b>,
  which is bridged to the IRC channel and using this you can participate in
  the same
  communications. <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/public-rooms/">Learn
  how to</a>.

</ul>

Neither of those methods require any invite or human intervention. Just show
up.
<p>
  
Neither method requires that you reveal your real name, actual identity, where
are located, or any other personal information. You decide what you are called
and what you want to share.

SUBTITLE(Speak)
<p>
  Be friendly and polite. We prefer curl oriented topics and subjects, but we
  are also tolerant and open for excursions into related areas of technology
  and development.

<p>
  The chat room is often visited by 200 or more concurrent participants - many
  of them idling for the moment.

<p>
  Joking is fine, but do it with respect for your fellow chat pals. We operate
  under a <a href="code-of-conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  
SUBTITLE(What if nobody responds)
<p>
  There is no guarantee anyone wants to respond or that anyone who reads right
  now even knows the answer to your question. Consider maybe post your
  questions or thoughts on a <a href="/mail/">suitable mailing list?</a> or
  <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions">GitHub discussions</a>?

SUBTITLE(Screenshot)
