TITLE(CA certificates extracted from Mozilla)
<div class="relatedbox">

</div>

<p>
 The Mozilla CA certificate store in PEM format (around 250KB uncompressed) is
 available from here over HTTPS:

<p>
 <big><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem">cacert.pem</a></big>

<p>
 This PEM file contains the datestamp of the conversion and we only make a new
 conversion if there's a change in either the script or the source file.

SUBTITLE(Recent CA file revisions per date of apperance)
<p><ul>
#include "../ca/pemlist.gen"
</ul>    

SUBTITLE(Missing Name Constraints)
<p>
  The converted PEM file only contains the digital signatures for CAs. Several
of those CAs have constraints in Firefox (and other browsers) to only be
allowed for certain domains and other similar additional conditions. Those
constraints are thus <b>not</b> brought along in this cacert file!
  
SUBTITLE(CA certificate store license)
<p>
 The PEM file is only a converted version of the original one and thus it is
 licensed under the same license as the Mozilla source file: MPL 2.0

SUBTITLE(Automated downloads from here)
<p>
 We don't mind you downloading the PEM file from us in an automated fashion,
 but please don't do it more often than once per day. It is only updated once
 every few months anyway.

<p>
 A suitable curl command line to only download it when it has changed:
<pre>
  curl <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-O">--remote-name</a> <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-z">--time-cond</a> cacert.pem https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
</pre>

SUBTITLE(The conversion script mk-ca-bundle)
<p>
 The <a href="mk-ca-bundle.html">mk-ca-bundle</a> tool
 converts <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>'s certificate store
 to PEM format, suitable for (lib)curl and others.

SUBTITLE(Convert from your local Firefox installation)

<p> You can also extract the ca certs off your Firefox installation, if you
 just have the 'certutil' tool installed and run
 the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/firefox-db2pem.sh">firefox-db2pem.sh</a>
 script!
