<p>
 This project has been alive for many years. At least __THANKSNUM__ persons
have provided code, feedback, advice etc that have improved curl. curl and
libcurl would not be what they are today without the help of friendly people
like this.

<p>
 If you have helped out but are missing in this list,
 please <a href="mailto:curl-web@haxx.se">tell us</a>! Note that this list may
 not include contributors who have used obvious fake names or strange aliases.
