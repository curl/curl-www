FTP-KRB bad message verification
================================

Project curl Security Advisory, June 27th 2022 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32208.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

When curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message verification
failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-In-The-Middle attack
to go unnoticed and even allows it to inject data to the client.

INFO
----

CVE-2022-32208 was introduced in [commit
54967d2a3a](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/54967d2a3a), shipped
in curl 7.16.4.

This flaw typically makes curl insert `599 ` (+ terminating null) into the
data where it detects the error, then the attackers data. It forces the
attacker to be somewhat creative to handle this initial hard-coded 5 byte
sequence of "junk".

FTP-KRB is a rarely used feature.
