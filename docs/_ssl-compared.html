SUBTITLE(Glossary of Terms)

<b>Supported:</b> "no" here means the TLS library is still <i>experimental</i>
in curl and we discourage using it in production.
<p>

<b>Native cert check:</b> The TLS library can verify server certificates
 against the platform's native CA cert store.
<p>

<b>CRL:</b> CRL means "Certificate Revocation List" and is used to check to
see if any certificates in the server's chain have been revoked for some
reason. If automatic, then the engine will automatically download a CRL and
use it to evaluate the trust of the server's certificate chain when performing
the TLS handshake. If manual, then the engine will not automatically use a
CRL, but you can provide one that has been downloaded separately by using the
CURLOPT_CRL option. If no, then the CURLOPT_CRL option will be ignored.
<p>

<b>SSLv2:</b> This was the first public release of the SSL protocol. It is
deprecated and really should no longer be used, because it has a number of
serious security problems.
<p>

<b>SSLv3:</b> It is deprecated and should no longer be used, because it has a
number of serious security problems.
<p>

<b>TLSv1.0:</b> TLS is a slight variation on SSLv3 that was the first version
of the protocol to be approved of by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF). This version of TLS has been available since 1999 and is by far the
most widely supported version on the public Internet. There have been a few
minor security vulnerabilities found in TLSv1.0 which were fixed later, but
all of them (so far) have been easily worked around, which has contributed to
the longevity of this version of TLS.
<p>

<b>TLSv1.1:</b> TLSv1.1 is similar to v1.0, except that it has a better fix
for the CBC (Cipher Block Chain) cipher-suite attack that lead to the BEAST
(Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) vulnerability in TLSv1.0.
<p>

<b>TLSv1.2:</b> TLSv1.2 provides better security than earlier versions, with
support for many all-new cipher suites that are even more difficult to
crack.
<p>

<b>TLSv1.3:</b> This is the most recent version. TLSv1.3 provides even better
security than TLSv1.2, with more data encrypted in the handshake etc. It also
offers less roundtrip handshakes.
<p>

<b>TLS SRP:</b> SRP means "Secure Remote Password" and it is a method of
performing client-side authentication with a TLS server by using a username
and password, sometimes coupled with a certificate. It is not yet widely
supported, but for the engines that do support it, you can provide the
credentials to curl by using the CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME and
CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD options.
<p>
<b>TLS ECC:</b> ECC means "Elliptic Curve Cryptography" and it is an advanced
set of cipher-suites that are used in TLS connections (typically with
TLSv1.2). Not all engines support ECC.
<p>
<b>QUIC API:</b> Needed for usingf this TLS library when implementing a QUIC
stack.
<p>
<b>QUIC Implementation:</b> A complete QUIC implementation, not just the API
necessary for someone else to implement it.
<p>
<b>Small:</b> can be built with a small foot-print. The system native ones also count
here since they come "for free" for users.
<p>
<b>Uses Certificate/Key Files:</b> Some engines, such as OpenSSL, read
certificates and keys from files rather than a central database. These engines
require you to use a certificate bundle in order to verify a server's
certificate chain; this is usually set at build time but can also be set by
using the CURLOPT_CAINFO option.
<p>

<b>Uses Certificate/Key Database:</b> Some engines, such as Apple's Security
framework, use a central database instead of separate files to store
certificates and keys. Apple's Security framework database, for instance, is
called the Keychain. For engines that use a database and do not also support
files, the CURLOPT_CAINFO option is ignored.
<p>

<b>Crypto module/token support:</b> Support for cryptographic hardware tokens
and software databases is typically provided via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11">; PKCS#11</a> on POSIX platforms,
and via platform-specific APIs on Windows and Darwin. Examples of PKCS#11
software tokens include the GNOME keyring, and the NSS "soft token" database.
<p>

<b>Integrates with system token database:</b> Platforms often have a
system-wide configuration which specifies which crypto modules/token should
be visible in which applications. Many Linux distributions have chosen
to use <a href="https://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/p11-kit.html">p11-kit</a>;
to provide this configuration, and some now consider it a bug for
applications <em>not</em> to automatically use the tokens configured therein.
<p>

<b>Select Certificates/Keys with PKCS#11 URI:</b> <a
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7512">RFC 7512</a> defines a
standard URI format for specifying objects within PKCS#11
tokens/databases.
<p>

<b>FIPS-140:</b> FIPS-140 is a security standard used by the United States and
Canada for transferring information that is sensitive but not classified. If
yes, and you are using curl or a libcurl-based application in the US or
Canadian government, or in a government contractor, then it is okay for you to
use the engine when building curl/libcurl.
<p>

<b>License:</b> If you are deploying an application that uses libcurl, then
the license used by the engine may affect whether or not you are able to
distribute your application legally. OpenSSL's 4-clause BSD license, for
instance, is not compatible with the GNU GPL.
