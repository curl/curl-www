SMTP end-of-response out-of-bounds read
=======================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 6th 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-3823.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the
end-of-response for SMTP.

If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains
no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the
`strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not
be returned to the caller.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
