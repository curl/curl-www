TFTP small blocksize heap buffer overflow
=========================================

Project curl Security Advisory, September 11th 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2019-5482.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function
(`tftp_receive_packet()`) that receives data from a TFTP server. It can call
`recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size
that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap
memory is controlled by the server.

This flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an `OACK` without the
`BLKSIZE` option, when a `BLKSIZE` smaller than 512 bytes was requested by the
TFTP client.  `OACK` is a TFTP extension and is not used by all TFTP servers.

Users choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the primary
use case for changing the size is to make it larger.

It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used
within local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always inherently insecure.

This issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP `BLKSIZE` option handling. It
was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical issue called
CVE-2019-5436.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-5482 to this issue.

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl >= 7.19.4 to and including 7.65.3
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.19.4 and libcurl >= 7.66.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0516ce7786e9500c2e44

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such.

SOLUTION
------------

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/facb0e4662415b5f28163

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.66.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

 C - do not use TFTP with curl with smaller than the default `BLKSIZE`

TIMELINE
