CVE-2023-27535: FTP too eager connection reuse
==============================================

Project curl Security Advisory, March 20th 2023 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-27535.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl would reuse a previously created FTP connection even when one or more
options had been changed that could have made the effective user a very
different one, thus leading to the doing the second transfer with wrong
credentials.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent
transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several FTP
settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match
too easily. The settings in questions are `CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT`,
`CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER`, `CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC` and `CURLOPT_USE_SSL`
level.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
