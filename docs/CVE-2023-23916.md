HTTP multi-header compression denial of service
===============================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 15th 2023 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-23916.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server
response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different
algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this "decompression chain" was
capped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious
server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by
using many headers.

The use of such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", making
curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to
and returning out of memory errors.

INFO
----

Automatic content decompression of content needs to be enabled per transfer
but the way Transfer-Encoding works in curl this code path and problem can be
reached with default options.

This flaw exists with one or more of the compression algorithms built-in
(gzip, brotli or zstd), but the individual algorithms have different
"exploding" powers.

Both `Content-Encoding:` and `Transfer-Encoding:` are affected over all HTTP
versions.

This flaw is almost identical to the previous [CVE-2022-32206: HTTP
compression denial of service](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32206.html), as
the fix for that earlier flaw was incomplete.

CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.57.0 to and including 7.87.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.57.0 and curl >= 7.88.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dbcced8e32b50c06

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

The amount of accepted "chained" algorithms is now capped to 5 in total,
independently of the number of headers.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/119fb187192a9ea13dc

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.88.0

 B - Apply the patch to your local version

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on January 8, 2023. We contacted
distros@openwall on February 7, 2023.

libcurl 7.88.0 was released on February 15 2023, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
