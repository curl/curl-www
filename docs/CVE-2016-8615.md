cookie injection for other servers
==================================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 2, 2016 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8615.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

If cookie state is written into a cookie jar file that is later read back and
used for subsequent requests, a malicious HTTP server can inject new cookies
for arbitrary domains into said cookie jar.

The issue pertains to the function that loads cookies into memory, which reads
the specified file into a fixed-size buffer in a line-by-line manner using the
`fgets()` function. If an invocation of `fgets()` cannot read the whole line
into the destination buffer due to it being too small, it truncates the
output. This way, a long cookie (name + value) sent by a malicious server
would be stored in the file and subsequently that cookie could be read
partially and crafted correctly, it could be treated as a different cookie for
another server.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2016-8615 to this issue.

CWE-187: Partial Comparison

Severity: High

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw exists in the following curl versions.

- Affected versions: curl 4.9 to and including 7.50.3
- Not affected versions: curl < 4.9 and curl >= 7.51.0
- Introduced-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d514d9

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
------------

In version 7.51.0, the cookie read function ignores too long lines.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/cff89bc088b7884098ea0c5378b

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.51.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

 C - Do not use the `CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE` (or `-b`) option.

TIMELINE
---------

It was first reported to the curl project on September 23 by Cure53.

We contacted distros@openwall on October 19.

curl 7.51.0 was released on November 2 2016, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.
