TITLE(curl and libcurl survey 2014 - analysis)

SUBTITLE(About the survey)

This survey ran in the beginning of June 2014 during 10 days. It was open to
the public and advertised on the curl mailing lists and via twitter and
Google+.

The survey was hosted by google.com which lead to some users avoiding
it. Other controversies among the questions led to another user category to
avoid responding.

Of course all answers are only indications to what the greater curl community
thinks and does.
