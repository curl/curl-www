curl removes wrong file on error
================================

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27778.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl might remove the wrong file when `--no-clobber` is used together with
`--remove-on-error`.

The `--remove-on-error` option tells curl to remove the output file when it
returns an error, and not leave a partial file behind. The `--no-clobber`
option prevents curl from overwriting a file if it already exists, and instead
appends a number to the name to create a new unused filename.

If curl adds a number to not "clobber" the output and an error occurs during
transfer, the remove on error logic would remove the *original* filename
without the added number.

INFO
----

This flaw is only present in the command line tool, not the library.

This flaw was introduced in curl 7.83.0 with the addition of these two options
that together created this problem. Since both these command line options are
brand new in this version, chances are not too many users have actually had
time to experience this problem.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-27778 to this issue.

CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

SOLUTION
------------

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/8c7ee9083d0d71

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

 A - Upgrade curl to version 7.83.1

 B - Apply the patch to your local version

 C - Do not use `--no-clobber` with `--remove-on-error`
