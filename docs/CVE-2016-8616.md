case insensitive password comparison
====================================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 2, 2016 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2016-8616.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of
user name and password with the existing connections.

This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a
protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that
connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the
correct password.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2016-8616 to this issue.

CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw exists in the following curl versions.

- Affected versions: curl 7.7 to and including 7.50.3
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.7 and curl >= 7.51.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

In version 7.51.0, the comparisons are done case sensitively.

A [patch for CVE-2016-8616](https://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2016-8616.patch) is
available.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.51.0

 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild
