wcurl path traversal with percent-encoded slashes
=================================================

Project curl Security Advisory, November 4 2025 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-11563.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

URLs containing percent-encoded slashes (`/` or `\`) can trick wcurl into
saving the output file outside of the current directory without the user
explicitly asking for it.

INFO
----

wcurl does not overwrite any files if the curl version is >= 7.83.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2025-11563 to this issue.
