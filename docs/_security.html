SUBTITLE(C mistakes)

<p>
 Flaws listed as "C mistakes" are vulnerabilities that we deem
 are <i>likely</i> to not have happened should we have used a memory-safe
 language rather than C. The C mistakes are divided into the following areas:
 OVERFLOW, OVERREAD, DOUBLE_FREE, USE_AFTER_FREE, NULL_MISTAKE, UNINIT and
 BAD_FREE.

 <a href="vuln.csv">vuln.csv</a> and <a href="vuln.json">vuln.json</a> provide
