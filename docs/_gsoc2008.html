TITLE(Google Summer of Code)
<p>
 We applied up to become a mentoring organization for <b>Google Summer of Code
 2008</b>, and on this page we collected ideas that could serve as starting
 points when students want to write up a project idea for curl!

<p>
 However, we were not lucky enough to be one of the selected organizations
 when Google announced the accepted ones on March 17 2008. The not accepted
 status is without motivation so we can only guess why this happened: too
 small/informal organization? Too crappy ideas page? Too few existing mentors
 listed? I don't think the actual application form was bad since it was very
 similar to the one I used for another project that was accepted...

SUBTITLE(Ideas)
<p>
 <b>New Protocols</b>

<ul>

<li> SMTP - although it isn't really yet determined that this would truly be a
 good addition. Prepare to explain to use why it is!

<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data:_URI_scheme">data: URLs</a>
 (mostly a case of completeness for applications that use libcurl for all
 URLs)

<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol">RTSP</a>
 is for streaming data

<li> MMS:// streams. A Microsoft protocol for streaming content. See the
 existing <a href="http://www.geocities.com/majormms/">mms client</a> source
 code for inspiration and start.

<li> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol">RTMP</a> A
patch for parts of this is mentioned <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5930#comment5">here</a>

<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3507.txt">ICAP</a>

</ul>

<p><b>Improving existing stuff</b>
<ul>
<li> native (i.e.: library-less) LDAP(S)

<li> Preparing for fips accreditation (using openssl fips)

<li> Complete Java integration/binding

<li> Fix the last remaining blocking calls within libcurl

<li> Fixing up lacking language bindings

<li> make the curl tool use the multi interface and allow it to do parallel
transfers

<li> Test suite improvements: adding support for more protocols. Most notably
 perhaps FTPS, telnet and ldap(s). Make a "native" stunnel version that works
 with the selected SSL library of choice.

</ul>

<p><b>Provide New Functionality</b>
<ul>
<li> HTTP Caching<br>
  This isn't as simple a problem as it might seem as there are
  potential issues with security and also because depending on use cases, you
  will want to store the cache in different places with different sizes...
<br>
  Or rather, a "caching framework" which allows the user to define callbacks
  for actually storing the data in a filesystem, database, or whatever he
  prefers.
<br>
  Some aspects of the HTTP standard are not well-known and people are bound to
  get them wrong if they implement caching themselves, e.g. the "Vary" and
  "Etag" headers.

<li> Non-blocking third party FTP transfers. libcurl did previously support
 third party FTP transfers (sometimes called FXP), but not in non-blocking
 manner and the code wasn't maintained properly so support was dropped.

</ul>

<p>
 Further sources to get ideas on what to work on is our <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/knownbugs.html">KNOWN_BUGS</a> and <a
 href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/todo.html">TODO</a> documents.

 <i>To become a mentor, you need to sign up for an account to google if curl
 gets accepted.</i>
