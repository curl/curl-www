use-after-free in handle close
==============================

Project curl Security Advisory, October 31st 2018 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16840.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap use-after-free flaw in code related to closing an easy
handle.

When closing and cleaning up an "easy" handle in the `Curl_close()` function,
the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might
then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already
freed struct.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
