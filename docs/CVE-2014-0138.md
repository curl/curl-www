wrong reuse of connections
==========================

Project curl Security Advisory, March 26th 2014
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-0138.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl can in some circumstances reuse the wrong connection when asked to
do transfers using other protocols than HTTP and FTP.

libcurl features a pool of recent connections so that subsequent requests
can reuse an existing connection to avoid overhead.

When reusing a connection a range of criterion must first be met. Due to an
error in the code, a transfer that was initiated by an application could
wrongfully reuse an existing connection to the same server that was
authenticated using different credentials. The existing logic basically only
worked well enough for HTTP and FTP, while all other network protocols were
silently, but erroneously, assumed to work like HTTP. Basically, protocols
that use connection oriented authentication need a new connection when new
credentials are used.

Affected protocols include: SCP, SFTP, POP3(S), IMAP(S), SMTP(S) and
LDAP(S).

Applications can disable libcurl's reuse of connections and thus mitigate
this problem, by using one of the following libcurl options to alter how
connections are or are not reused: `CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT`,
`CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS` and `CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS` (if using the
curl_multi API).

(This problem is very similar to a problem previously reported to NTLM HTTP
connections, named [CVE-2014-0015](CVE-2014-0015.html))

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2014-0138 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

This flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support these other
protocols, although the code has been restructured a few times over the
years so the mistake has altered shape.

- Affected versions: from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.35.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.10.6 and >= 7.36.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

SOLUTION
--------

libcurl 7.36.0 makes sure that connections are reused more strictly.

- Fixed-in: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/517b06d657aceb11a2

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

 A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.36.0

 B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

TIMELINE
---------

It was reported to the curl project on February 15th 2014. We contacted
distros@openwall on March 16 2014.

libcurl 7.36.0 was released on March 26th 2014, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
