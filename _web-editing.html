TITLE(Website Editing Guidelines)

SUBTITLE(How to build)
<p>
 Documented in the website's
 <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-www/blob/master/README.md">GitHub
 repository</a>.

SUBTITLE(To think of)
<p> The pages are preprocessed before they are finalized. The preprocessor
  is a simple C-style one, but please take care so that #if and #ifdefs
  have an ending #endif and so on.

<p> The website contents is synced automatically from git every 20 minutes.
  Even if you fix a mistake, it will stay that way at least until next update.
  Do not panic!

<p> The site is hosted by CDN front-ends that fetch content from the master
  server and cache it. It makes some updates to the content to take a while
  until truly visible to end users.

SUBTITLE(Lots of content come from the source repository)
<p>
  Large portions of the website is generated content that comes from the
  <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">source code repository</a> (often as
  markdown). The website build directory needs a symlink to a checkout for
  that purpose.
<p>
  Lot of content is also generated data/tables etc that uses content from the
  source repository and that rerun the scripts when the source changes. The
  Makefiles of course have all the details.

SUBTITLE(What to edit/update)
<p> Add news items whenever you have interesting "news" you think the curl
  community might enjoy. The news section also serves a purpose of making it
  apparent that the site is living. Try to follow the tradition and style of
  previous news items. Note the use of the macros.

<p> The download page is maintained at <a href="/dl">dl</a> and needs
  special access rights.

<p> Edit bad language use, bad spelling or confusing use of words.

<p> If the problem is in a page out of control from the website, chances
  are that the page is generated automatically from a file in the source code
  archive and then <i>that</i> file could be corrected instead.

SUBTITLE(Pull requests)
<p>
  Submit proposed changes as
  regular <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-www/pulls">pull-requests</a>.
  CI jobs will do basic verifications.

SUBTITLE(Not in the git repo)
<p>
 Site content that is not mirrored and thus only available from <a
 href="//curl.se/">curl.se</a>:
<ul>
<li> <tt>/mail/</tt> Mailing list archives
<li> <tt>/download/</tt> Curl release archives/packages
<li> <tt>/snapshots/</tt> daily snapshots
</ul>
