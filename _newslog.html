 NSUBJ(libcurl NTLM Buffer Overflow)
 NDATE(22 February 2005)
 NCOLS

  As was <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/391042">posted to
  bugtraq</a>, all versions of curl that supports NTLM has this flaw. The <a
  href="http://cool.haxx.se/cvs.cgi/curl/lib/http_ntlm.c.diff?r1=1.36&r2=1.37">fix</a>. It
  requires a malicious server to send an unexpectedly long NTLM response
  header to trigger. (No, we were not contacted nor notified about this
  problem before they went public.)

<p>
  I'll be away for a week now but I'll put together a new release when I get

 NDATE(21 Jan 2003)
 NCOLS
<p>
I've spent some time on putting together a shell script that I would like
people to run on various operating systems. The script testcurl does:
<ol>
 <li> updates curl source from CVS
 <li> generates the build environment (using buildconf)
 <li> runs configure (optionally using your custom arguments)
 <li> builds curl (in a separate build-dir)
 <li> runs the tests (make test)
 <li> removes the build dir
</ol>
<p>
The output from all this should be mailed to the automatic receiver I've
setup for this purpose.
<p>
Personally, I'll setup and run this script on a Solaris 2.7 host and at least
one Linux i386. I'll make sure that these run regularly.
<p>
So, if you have some CPU cycles to spare and some time to set things up,
please get in touch and help us out.
<p>
The collected status of all distributed tests that are collected will of
course be viewable on the curl web site, and I'm smoothing out the scripts
for it right now.

 NSUBJ(Regarding the recent flow of SSL security flaws)
 NDATE(20 Aug 2002)
 NCOLS
 
   On August 5th, Mike Benham posted his initial <a
   href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/286290/2002-07-31/2002-08-06/0">IE
   security advisory</a> regarding how IE doesn't properly verify SSL
   certificates.
 <p>
   This has been discussed in curl mailing lists regarding how curl behaves on
   similar situations and to make this clear here and now: <b>curl does no
   peer certificate checks <i>at all</i> unless specifically told to</b>.
 <p>
   This means that man-in-the-middle attacks can easily be performed on
   servers that you curl to, unless you tell curl to verify the certificate
   with a CA.
 <p>
   This is how the SSL and certificates have been implemented in curl, on
   purpose. This is not a flaw. We might have reasons to reconsider how the
   documention on this matter should be spelled out and properly displayed,
   and we might even change the future behavior somewhat.
 <p>
   Of course we need your input on what to do and what not to do.
