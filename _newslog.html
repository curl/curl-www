  The HTTPS download is provided via github so it will also provide an

  make the "users" sections (for the curl tool and for libcurl) cleaner and
  more focused on what I suspect web users are looking for.

 COLRED

  A "friendly" person deleted huge parts of cool.haxx.se today, which among

  all list info etc are gone.

  <p> We <i>should</i> be able to restore some of it from backups. Stay tuned.
  Please allow a few days before all things are back to normal.

  <p> It was done by using a security hole in twiki - used for another project
  on the same server. Aren't the world full of friendly souls? The IP
  originated from a country/region that makes it no point in persuing this

 NSUBJ(Help out autobuilding curl on multiple platforms!)
 NDATE(21 Jan 2003)
 NCOLS
<p>
I've spent some time on putting together a shell script that I would like
people to run on various operating systems. The script testcurl does:
<ol>
 <li> updates curl source from CVS
 <li> generates the build environment (using buildconf)
 <li> runs configure (optionally using your custom arguments)
 <li> builds curl (in a separate build-dir)
 <li> runs the tests (make test)
 <li> removes the build dir
</ol>
<p>
The output from all this should be mailed to the automatic receiver I've
setup for this purpose.
<p>
Personally, I'll setup and run this script on a Solaris 2.7 host and at least
one Linux i386. I'll make sure that these run regularly.
<p>
So, if you have some CPU cycles to spare and some time to set things up,
please get in touch and help us out.
<p>
The collected status of all distributed tests that are collected will of
course be viewable on the curl web site, and I'm smoothing out the scripts
for it right now.
<p>
The script is currently available here:
 <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/curl/testcurl.sh">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/curl/curl/testcurl.sh</a>.

   On August 5th, Mike Benham posted his initial <a
   href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/286290/2002-07-31/2002-08-06/0">IE
   security advisory</a> regarding how IE doesn't properly verify SSL
   certificates.
 <p>
   This has been discussed in curl mailing lists regarding how curl behaves on
   similar situations and to make this clear here and now: <b>curl does no
   peer certificate checks <i>at all</i> unless specifically told to</b>.
 <p>
   This means that man-in-the-middle attacks can easily be performed on
   servers that you curl to, unless you tell curl to verify the certificate
   with a CA.
 <p>
   This is how the SSL and certificates have been implemented in curl, on
   purpose. This is not a flaw. We might have reasons to reconsider how the
   documention on this matter should be spelled out and properly displayed,
   and we might even change the future behavior somewhat.
 <p>
   Of course we need your input on what to do and what not to do.
