 NSUBJ(Help out autobuilding curl on multiple platforms!)
 NDATE(21 Jan 2003)
 NCOLS
<p>
I've spent some time on putting together a shell script that I would like
people to run on various operating systems. The script testcurl does:
<ol>
 <li> updates curl source from CVS
 <li> generates the build environment (using buildconf)
 <li> runs configure (optionally using your custom arguments)
 <li> builds curl (in a separate build-dir)
 <li> runs the tests (make test)
 <li> removes the build dir
</ol>
<p>
The output from all this should be mailed to the automatic receiver I've
setup for this purpose.
<p>
Personally, I'll setup and run this script on a Solaris 2.7 host and at least
one Linux i386. I'll make sure that these run regularly.
<p>
So, if you have some CPU cycles to spare and some time to set things up,
please get in touch and help us out.
<p>
The collected status of all distributed tests that are collected will of
course be viewable on the curl web site, and I'm smoothing out the scripts
for it right now.

The script is currently available here:

   href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/286290/2002-07-31/2002-08-06/0">IE
   security advisory</a> regarding how IE doesn't properly verify SSL
   certificates.
 <p>
   This has been discussed in curl mailing lists regarding how curl behaves on
   similar situations and to make this clear here and now: <b>curl does no
   peer certificate checks <i>at all</i> unless specifically told to</b>.
 <p>
   This means that man-in-the-middle attacks can easily be performed on
   servers that you curl to, unless you tell curl to verify the certificate
   with a CA.
 <p>
   This is how the SSL and certificates have been implemented in curl, on
   purpose. This is not a flaw. We might have reasons to reconsider how the
   documention on this matter should be spelled out and properly displayed,
   and we might even change the future behavior somewhat.

   Of course we need your input on what to do and what not to do.

  curl and libcurl "GPL compatible" and thus there are no longer anything that

  During the past eight weeks, some 4500 people arrived at this site after

 NSUBJ(libcurl in upcoming PHP release)
 NDATE(25 July 2000)
 NCOLS

  Sterling Hughes brought me the information that the upcoming release of PHP
  4.0.2 is planned to have native support for retrieving URLs by using libcurl
  7!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Changes)
 NDATE(25 July 2000)
 NCOLS

  I implementing fixes, applying patches and improve things according to mails
  I got during my absense. Expect a new beta release soon.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Vacation is over)
 NDATE(24 July 2000)
 NCOLS

  I'm now back again from my vacation in Mexico. I expect to start replying to
  mail and work again this week. I'll get back with a release time schedule
  when I've read all my curl mails. Thanks for being patient.

 NSUBJ(win32 binary beta)
 NDATE(22 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  There's now a <a href="/beta/">7.0.8 win32 beta</a> available as a
  binary</a>.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(The upcoming release of version 7)
 NDATE(21 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  I've decided to wait with the release of curl v7 until get back from my
  vacation. I'll leave for Mexico for a month starting June 24th and I really
  don't see any point in releasing something just moments before I take
  off. It would only cause my mailbox to flood over while I'm away.
  <p>
  Instead, I leave you all with enough time in your hands to download the
  latest beta and really try it out.
  <p>
  <b>If you discover bugs or have problems (not found in documents or online)
  while I'm gone, please consider using the <a href="/mail/">mailing lists</a>
  and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=976">bug tracker</a>
  before mailing me privately. I won't be able to respond to any mails until
  the end of July.</b>

 NSUBJ(number nine is alive)
 NDATE(20 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  <a href="/beta/">Curl 7.0.8beta</a> was just moved to the beta directory.
  Read the CHANGES and have try out the new Location:-fixes...

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(downloads and help)
 NDATE(19 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  I announced the 7.0.7beta on freshmeat the other day and we got some ~200
  downloads right away. This still hasn't resulted in any increased number of
  bug reports... <br> BTW, I'd like to remind you people of the <a
  href="help.html">help page</a> for all you who have a spare minute and would
  like to help our project a little. We don't just need programming help,
  there's a lot of other things you can do too to help!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(7.0.7beta)
 NDATE(16 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  So, with the patch of yesterday and some more fixes that should sort out the
  progress bar and meter, I put up another beta release. I've also removed
  some #ifdef'ed code why the package shrunk 1KB.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(patch your beta)
 NDATE(15 June 2000)
 NCOLS
  This <a href="beta/http.patch">patch</a> makes your 7.0.X beta perform better
  HTTP POST operations!
 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(More betas)
 NDATE(14 June 2000 afternoon)
 NCOLS

  I uploaded the 7.0.5beta about the same time I added a search field in the
  footer of every web page on the site. Studying how people end up on this
  site, it shows that an awful lot of people pop in on an odd page using a
  search engine, and since that page isn't always 100% on focus with what the
  person was after I think I can decrease some amount of problems by offering
  a site search field straight away! Hopefully this is the last beta before I
  release version 7 for real!
  <br>
 <font color="#ff0000">I uploaded a 7.0.6beta as well since too many errors
 had slipped into the 7.0.5 package...</font>

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(This and that)
 NDATE(14 June 2000 morning)
 NCOLS

  Tiny edits, updated docs and just minor fiddling. I think I can feel a
  release very near now.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Non-beta seven soon?)
 NDATE(8 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  If you have any reports on the version seven beta-series, please bring them
  in! I'm planning to get a non-beta released within a week or something. I
  will be gone for four weeks, starting at June 24th, and I really would like
  to get the version seven out well before that so I get some time to smoothen
  out any possible problems and update the web pages with up-to-date ports etc

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(We have a team!)
 NDATE(8 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  As of today, Jörn Hartroth is now a trusted CVS write access team member!
  Jörn has patiently been working with the win32 ports of curl as well as the
  multiple-URL stuff for a long time now. His write access will mean less work
  for me to incorporate his fixes and he'll be able to quicker solve problems.
  Welcome!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(TLD hopping)
 NDATE(6 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">curl.haxx.se</a> is the new curl site since <a
  href="http://www.haxx.se">Haxx</a> changed TLD just now. The old haxx.nu
  domain will probably hang around another year or so. I'll add a redirect as
  well so that the transfer will probably hardly be noticable for most people.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Debian joins the growing list)
 NDATE(5 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  With the recent addition of the updated Debian curl 6.5.2 archive, we have
  21 different up-to-date binary archives from the <a
  href="download.html">download page</a>.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(more libcurl docs appearing)
 NDATE(2 June 2000)
 NCOLS

  The <a href="/libcurl/docs/">libcurl docs</a> page has been updated with
  detailed descriptions of six more libcurl functions. Now, all the functions
  used by the curl application are documented (hm, ok, curl_formparse() isn't
  yet as of this writing). It would be cool if anyone who uses these could
  have a look and just point out my biggest mistakes.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Beta-Mania Season)
 NDATE(31 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  <a href="/beta/">Version 7.0.3beta</a> arrived just a bunch of hours after
  the 7.0.2 just because I discovered the 7.0.2 doesn't compile on Linux
  systems due to incompatible gethostbyname_r() calls in Solaris (and others,
  like IRIX) and Linux (any other?). Only some 6 or 7 people downloaded the
  previous version.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Another Beta Version is Out)
 NDATE(30 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  <a href="/beta/">Version 7.0.2beta</a> is yet more internal fixes and even
  some noticable corrections from the previous betas. I still need
  feedback. Especially comments on the new library interface.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(This site is now indexed)
 NDATE(30 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  So, a nightly index allows for a cool search ability in order to better
  allow people to dig trough all the information that start to pile up
  here. Especially the mailing <a href="mail.cgi">list archives</a> are
  otherwise a bit hard to deal with. Go and try a <a
  href="htdig/">search</a>. Search engine in use: <a
  href="http://htdig.org">htdig</a>.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(email addresses slightly remodeled)
 NDATE(25 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  On request from several people, I hacked in an option to hypermail that now
  allows it to mangle email addresses slightly in ordere to make them less
  attractive to those spammers' email-collecting robots. The mailing list <a
  href="archive-2000-05/">archive from May</a> and onwards will no longer show
  any email addresses with any actual @-letters in them.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(libcurl docs in the pipe)
 NDATE(25 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I've started to produce some documentation around the new libcurl
  interface. They're gonna be man pages and on this web site, they appear over
  on the <a href="/libcurl/docs/">libcurl docs pages</a>. Have an early
  peek. It really isn't much yet.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(win32 openssl binaries here)
 NDATE(24 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I get so many questions about where to find the win32 versions of the
  precompiled openssl libraries so I asked Jörn Hartroth to bring them to me
  and now I have a link to them from the <a href="download.html">download
  page</a>.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(freshmeat speeds things up)
 NDATE(23 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  So I posted the news about curl 7 beta on <a
  href="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat.net</a> and suddenly a large amount of
  people have downloaded beta archives! :-)

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Extensive renaming of libcurl symbols)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  To give you a taste of the new names in libcurl, I felt I should upload a <a
  href="/beta/">new beta</a>. I'll try to keep them coming pretty frequently
  now, why I won't always bother to make noise about every single new release.
 <p>
  Jörn Hartroth brought me a win32-binary of that beta that I also put on the
  beta download page. Have fun.
 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Version seven is now head CVS branch)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I have now applied all the changes to the main branch in <a
  href="cvs.html">CVS</a> and I'll try not to look back too much in the
  mirror. All new development will be made on the v7-line of sources, and
  they'll be a bit easier to get off the CVS server now. No need to specify
  any extra labels.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Slow beta feedback)
 NDATE(22 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  It's been four days since I uploaded the 7.0 beta release here, and so far
  exactly nobody has told me if it works, or if it isn't. Very few persons
  have actually downloaded it. I need your help friends, please get it and try
  it!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(First version seven beta)
 NDATE(18 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  Get your copy of the <a href="/beta/">Curl 7 beta</a>. Read the CHANGES
  file, study the <a href="version7.html">version 7 page</a>. Post bug reports
  and feel free to comment the changes.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Version seven)
 NDATE(18 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  <a href="version7.html">Curl version 7 explained</a>. We're not quite there
  yet, but things are moving in the right direction...

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Other ports)
 NDATE(16 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I discovered a chinese site that features what seems to be a mirror of a HP
  freeware site and they have up-to-date <a href="download.html#hpux">curl
  packages</a>. If you know of other sites that do this kind of work, please
  let me know.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Download stats)
 NDATE(16 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  Around 1000 copies a week are downloaded from this site, all different
  archives combined. I think it is pretty interesting since it was a while
  since the latest release.

 NSUBJ(Planning for libcurl 7)
 NDATE(12 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I've made a lot of work on the internals of the lib now, and <a
  href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1594/0/3729648/">this is
  what to expect</a> for the nearest future. Bring me your feedback, ideas and
  opinions!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Library design philosophy)
 NDATE(12 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I posted a <a
  href="http://curl.haxx.se/archive-2000-05/0037.html">discussion material</a>
  to the mailing list regarding how to deal with portable functions the lib
  features internally, that has nothing to do with URL transfers, but that the
  application might want to feature as well. Subscribe, join in, take part!

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(FTP)
 NDATE(10 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  FTP style URLs. The directory part of FTP URLs were not treated
  properly. Now I make sure to URL-decode <i>after</i> I've separated the path
  into directory and file name. I've also changed the way curl performs now,
  in that it will now make a CWD to the specified directory and there it will
  make the operation on the file. This also has the benefit that ftp upload
  will work better on the funet FTP server (I mean the actual software, not
  that particular site).

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(porting)
 NDATE(10 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  A system turned up that curl didn't compile very well on. strcasecmp(), ldap
  defines and it requires <b>two</b> libs for gethostbyname() to link got me
  busy for a while.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(libcurl 7 moves)
 NDATE(2 May 2000)
 NCOLS

  I've actually fetched both FTP and HTTP documents using the new to-become
  library. It isn't really there yet, but it crawls in the right direction...

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(let it become libcurl 7!)
 NDATE(27 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  I didn't come up with any ideas nor did anyone else present any that made my
  hair rise. So, as some pointed out, instead we go with the somewhat familiar
  name 'libcurl' and just call the new design version 7. There has been some
  discussions about it and you can now see parts of it in the CVS.

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(CVS branch newlib)
 NDATE(26 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  I created a branch in the CVS for the new lib experiments. 'newlib' is the
  new tag. To checkout this, checkout as normal and after the checkout
  command, you issue <tt>cvs update -rnewlib</tt>. Volia, you'll then get my
  very early stuff.  <b>Warning</b> it is not working, if it even compiles for
  you...

 NCOLE

 NSUBJ(Decrease amount of spam)
 NDATE(26 Apr 2000)
 NCOLS

  To make the email addresses posted on these web pages a little less likely
  to be extracted by robots and used for spam, I've replaced all @-signs in
  the email addresses with '_at_'.
