<p>
 On December 19
 2017, <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/containers/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/382409">Microsoft
 announced</a> that since insider build 17063 of Windows 10, curl is a default
 component.

SUBTITLE(Windows 10/11 bundle curl)
<p>
 Every installation of Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 11 has curl installed
 by default.
<p>
 The Microsoft provided version is built to use the Schannel TLS backend.
 Invoking curl -V after the <b>October 2024</b> update shows this on these
 platforms:
<p>
<div class="term">
<div class="tline">curl 8.9.1 (Windows) libcurl/8.9.1 Schannel zlib/1.3 WinIDN</div>
<div class="tline">Release-Date: 2024-07-31</div>
<div class="tline">Protocols: dict file ftp ftps http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp</div>
<div class="tline">Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS HSTS HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI threadsafe Unicode UnixSockets</div>
</div>

SUBTITLE(Disabled features)
<p>
  The Microsoft curl build omits several good features:
<ul>
  <li> no Public Suffix List (PSL) support, making it impossible to prevent "super cookies"
  <li> no support for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
  <li> no support for GOPHER(S), LDAP(S), RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, WS(S))
  <li> no brotli or zstd compression
</ul>

SUBTITLE(Separate)
<p>
 The curl tool shipped with Windows is built by and handled by Microsoft. It
 is a separate build that will have different features and capabilities
 enabled and disabled compared to the <a href="/windows/">Windows builds</a>
 offered by the curl project. They do however build curl from the same source
 code. If you have problems with their curl version, report that to them.
 See <a target="_blank" rel="external"

  Microsoft Feedback Hub</a> from more information.
<p>
 You can probably assume that the curl packages from Microsoft will always lag
 behind the versions provided by the curl project itself.

SUBTITLE(A Powershell alias)
<p>
 The curl tool comes installed <i>in addition to</i> the
 dreaded <a target="_blank" rel="author"
          href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/19/removing-the-powershell-curl-alias/">curl
 alias</a> that plagues Powershell users since it is an alias that runs the
 invoke-webrequest command and therefore is not acting much like curl at all.
<p>
 A work-around is to invoke curl as "curl.exe" to prevent powershell from
 treating it as an alias.
