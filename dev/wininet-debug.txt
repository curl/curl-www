Subject: Re: using cURL: how to sniff what IE sends to server

Assuming Gennady is using a Microsoft platform (IE doesn't exist for UNIXes
does it?) ssldump don't do much good, unless someone ports it to Windows.

A tool that might be useful is a "debug" version of wininet.dll. It's available
as part of the Platform SDK from MSDN.microsoft.com. Attached is a version that
should work with IE5.5 (and maybe also IE5.01), plus microsoft's instructions
for using it. Basically, you replace the copy of wininet.dll on your system
with this one (saving a copy of yours first of course). Then you set an
environment variable (or a registry entry) a certain way and then start
internet explorer. All internet network requests will be captured into a
logfile. Because this is basically a debugging dump of all API calls into the
WinInet libraries, the logfile will be a bit cryptic, but it will probably have
the info you need.

Another option might be to utilize an advanced feature of a personal proxy
server, like Muffin (http://muffin.doit.org/) or WebWasher. One of Muffin's
features is to display all HTTP headers going back and forth, and it can do
SSL. Basically, you install it, and then reconfigure IE to use Muffin as a
proxy server (on a non-standard port on your local machine). Muffin in turn
makes the HTTP requests for you, and can show you what it did on your behalf.
When I was playing with it last year, it seemed pretty buggy and hard to work
with, but you only have to make it work once ;-)

Good luck!

This SDK includes a debug version of WININET.DLL. The debug version of this
DLL is capable of generating a wininet.log file in the current directory.
This file can be used for debug purposes to view parameters passed to various
API calls as well as viewing actual data sent and received by WinInet. To
enable debugging follow these steps:

1. Rename the current wininet.dll in the %SystemRoot%\sytem32 on NT system
   directory or in %windir%\system directory for Windows 95 to wininet.org.
2. run "Expand WinInet.dl_ WinInet.Dll" to decompress the debug version of
   WinInet.Dll, or get a version from the checked build of NT.
2. Copy this debug version of Wininet.dll to the %SystemRoot%\sytem32 for
   Windows NT or to %windir%\system directory for Windows 95.
3. Reboot the system.

The above steps are necessary because the shell process locks wininet.dll, 
so it can not be replaced when loaded. To generate a debug log file, start a 
command window and type "set wininetlog=1" at the prompt (without quotes). 
At this point any application using WinInet started from this command prompt 
will generate a corresponding log file. By default log file is called
wininet.log. The log will be created in the application's current directory
and	will be replaced with each new execution of the application. Please note
that application may change its	current directory (by calling _chdir() C
run time function, for example). Microsoft Internet Explorer (Iexplore.exe)
changes default directory to desktop, so regardless directory where
Iexplore.exe is started, default wininet.log file will be generated in the
desktop directory. You can change this by setting environment/registry
(see below about registry location) variable WininetLogFile, like this: "set
wininetlogfile=c:\temp\MyNewLog.log". This variable can handle
absolute/relative path semantics. Therefore, if you give an absolute path, you
know exactly where the log file will be generated


If the application is a service (on Windows NT for example) and can not
be started from the command prompt, the wininetlog registry key of type 
REG_DWORD at:
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" 
controls logging behavior. Setting this variable to 1 enables logging, 
setting it to 0 disables it. A wininet.log file will be created in the 
application directory (i.e. in the directory of corresponding exe image for
the service). As with the environment variable, WininetLogFile registry key of
type REG_SZ controls name and location of the generated log file.

If you set logging via registry, every wininet app that starts will try to
generate the same log file unless individual WininetLogFile variables are
specified for each application. This may result in a race condition. For this
reason, setting WininetLog and WininetLogFile in the registry is less
effective than creating environment variables, unless absolutely necessary.

Please note that log files grow very rapidly and will degrade application 
performance. A simple WinInet application submitting one Http request via 
HttpSendRequest may easily generate about a 1 MB log file, please plan hard
 drive space accordingly.  

            How to interpret the wininet.log file.
The log file reflects APIs called directly from the WinInet.dll.
Data sent/received by WinInet are also logged. Calls on each subsequent
level will be indented to the right. Each API shows parameters either
as a hex value (for addresses) or as an ASCII string. Setting environmental
variable wininetlog=1 not only enables logging, bug also initializes default
logging level (i.e. what and how should be logged). This explanation assumes
default logging level. A typical line in the log file looks	like this (all
on one line):

16:27:55.759 00000108:<app> 001 InternetOpenUrlA(0xcc0004, "http://corky",
"Accept: */*\r\nAccept: image/gif\r\nAccept: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n", 54, 
0x04000000, 0x0)

The above line shows that the ASCII version of InternetOpenUrl has been called.
Parameters to the call are shown as strings for the server name and headers and
as hex values for handles and for option flags. Each line of the file is
prefixed with following information:

1. Time stamp in following format: HH:MM:SS.SSS
2. Thread ID as a hexadecimal number. 00000108 in the above sample.
3. Asynchronous execution ID. In the above sample it is <app>. Async. ID will 
   be explained later in this document.
4. Call depth. In the sample above InternetOpenUrl was the first call.

					  Asynchronous operation of WinInet.
A programmer may choose to call WinInet.dll functions asynchronously. 
In this case calls that would normally block (such as HttpSendRequest) will
immediately fail with error ERROR_IO_PENDING. Further progress of the 
asynchronous calls can be monitored via callback functions. Please see the SDK
documentation for more information on the asynchronous operation of  WinInet.
To handle asynchronous requests WinInet creates a worker thread. This thread
calls callback functions and also performs scheduling of submitted requests.
The log file reflects the status of the asynchronous requests via its ID as 
follows:

1. <app> - call from the application thread.
2. <c-b> - async worker thread calling back into the app; any WinInet API 
    requests during this time treated as though from the app context
3. <-----> - internal call performed by WinInet for the purpose of 
   scheduling asynchronous requests.
4. <XXXXX> - where XXXXX is a decemal number, reflecting the asynchronous ID.

                          Debugging tips.
The debug facility of WinInet generates a wealth of information that should 
be used wisely.  If WinInet uses an SSL/PCT connection, the log will show
clear text sent and received from the server. The log for multithreaded 
applications with many asynchronous calls may be very complex. To aid the
debugging process you can parse the entire log by thread id. This will
allow you to see what happens in a specific thread (remember that the 
asynchronous id for application threads will have the <app> stamp).
Multiple threads can share one HINTERNET handle. In this case parsing the 
entire log by the handle value can show the handle lifetime: from opening it 
to calling InternetCloseHandle. Note that this may spawn multiple threads. 
Don't forget to restore the original wininet.dll upon completion of a 
debugging session.
