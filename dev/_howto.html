SUBTITLE(Get a Fresh Check-out from git)
<p>
 First, run these commands:

<pre>
  $ mkdir someplacenice
  $ cd someplacenice
  $ git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git
  $ ./curl/tests/testcurl.pl
</pre>
<p>
 The first time to run <a href="testcurl.html">testcurl.pl</a>, it will prompt
 you for some info (unless you provide that data using command line options).
 That info is then stored in the filen amed 'setup' in the current directory
 and will be used when this script is subsequently run. The format is easily
 manually edited using a text editor.
<p>
 you will now see a full compile, build and test perform. Make sure everything
 works out fine.

<p>
 Then, in a cron job do:
<pre>
 $ cd someplacenice
 $ ./curl/tests/testcurl.pl | mail -s "autobuild" curl-autocompile@haxx.se
</pre>
<p>

<b>Note:</b> It is important that you do include the word 'autobuild' in the
 subject of the mail, as mails to this receiver without that word in the
 subject will mercilessly get sent to /dev/null with no questions asked.

#if 0
<p>
 If mailing the info is not suitable for you, but you have a working curl
 version installed, you can upload the file with curl self:
<pre>
 $ ./curl/tests/testcurl.pl | curl -s -F file=@- https://curl.se/dev/upload.cgi
</pre>
<p>
 You can also use this
 <a href="https://curl.se/dev/upload.cgi">upload form</a> "manually".
#endif

SUBTITLE(Other platforms than Unix)

 On Unix/Linux testcurl.pl assumes a GNU-like build with configure; on Win32
 the MSVC build is default. The testcurl.pl can now take an option
 '<tt>--target=[your_os]</tt>' so you can specify to build targets for other
 platforms. With this option it should now be very easy to add other
 autobuilds for platforms not able to use GNU-like build systems.

SUBTITLE(Build from daily tarballs)
<p>
 If you cannot checkout or update the sources from git easily, another approach
 to automated testing of the latest sources is made by getting the latest <a
 href="https://curl.se/snapshots/">daily tarballs</a> automatically
 instead.
<p>
 This is easily done with the use of the <a href="autocurl.txt">autocurl</a>
 shell script, written by Ralph Mitchell.

SUBTITLE(Make more tests run)
<p>
 The number of tests run on some tests are not the maximum amount, but instead
 numerous ones are "skipped".
<p>
 This is because some of the tests require special conditions that are not
 enabled everywhere. You can improve this situation by using the configure's
 <b>--enable-debug</b> option (which enables much more thorough memory and
 netrc debugging) and to make sure that you have <b>stunnel</b> installed
 (which enables HTTPS tests to run).

SUBTITLE(Build Table Updates)
<p>
The tables are rebuilt every 20 minutes if there has been a new build log
mailed in since the previous table was built.
<p>
We automatically remove build logs older than 10 - 12 days to reduce the
amount of data and used disk space.
