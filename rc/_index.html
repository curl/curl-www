<p>
  Release candidates are pre-releases that include all features targeted for
  the pending curl release.
<p>
  Please try release candidates in your use cases and products and verify that
  everything works as intended.
<p>
  Test the new features and options and verify that they work the way they are
  documented, and maybe also the way you think they should. Features that have
  not shipped in a release yet can still be marginally tweaked if deemed
  desirable.
<p>
  <b>Do not use release candidates in producttion</b>. They are work in
  progress. Use them for testing and verification only. Use actual releases in
  production.
<p>
  Releases candidates are ephemeral. They are provided only for a few weeks
  until they are automatically removed. The coming release is scheduled to
  happen on <b>__NEXTDATE</b>.

SUBTITLE(Contents)
<p> Each release candidate is provide in four different file formats. They all
  have the exact same content.

<p> <b>docs/RELEASE-TOOLS.md</b> in the tarball shows the tooling needed to
 reproduce it.

<p> <b>docs/tarball-commit.txt</b> in the tarball shows the exact commit hash
  that was the HEAD at the time the tarball was made. There are no git tags
  set for release candidates.

SUBTITLE(Release cycle)
<p>
  The idea is to provide three release candidates before every release,
  distributed as displayed in the image below.

<p>
  <ul>
    <li> rc1 comes the day the feature release starts, 25 days before release
    <li> rc2 comes nine days after rc1, 16 days before release
    <li> rc3 comes nine days after rc2, 7 days before release
  </ul>
